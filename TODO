Hmm ... can this be fixed with the xmkmf files?
I am not the official xbae maintainer; and xbae is supposed
to compile & work with a number of unix platforms.
The redme should indicate how to reach the author;  since the
maintainer seems busy at the moment, try sending them a unified diff.

Yes, I know, haven't figured out why yet ...

8) traversing  doesn't work for mutla, stock funds

9) For SGI Irix, mystery core dump when creating mubmenus ...
   related to menu initialization complaints with sgi compiler.

10) cleared balances are incorrectly shown for stock accounts

11) stock portfolio should indicate total $ amount of transaction

12) all messages should be moved out so that translation to foreign
    languages would be possible.

13) transfer window should allow share prices to be entered;
    but these should grey out when dealing with ordinary bank accounts.

14) Allow transfers of funds to be done in-line

15) Allow an account to be designated as a double-entry-only account.


Fixed bugs:
