For plans regarding future GnuCash features, please consult
the file:  doc/projects.html, or its clone: 
 http://cvs.gnucash.org/linux/gnucash/projects.html
However, these files are currently (4/03) far out of date.

Currently, This TODO file is the start of a categorized list 
of developers' notes of work noted and left for later, together 
with the a list of developers.  If a work item is substantial 
enough to require an RFE, the item and all discussion, status, 
and progress reports are kept in bugzilla, with no references 
from bugzilla to the TODO file, or vice versa.

If you want to work on the Gnome2 port, please let me (TomF) 
know what subcategories you want to work on.  New categories 
are welcome.
