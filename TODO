Open, known bugs, desired enhancements:

> 2)  Typing a name of a .dat file which doesn't exist allows xacc to
>     start, but on the console it prints "FileIO.c: Line 151, error =
>     No such file or directory"
Should probably be a popup.

> 3)  Selecting "File", "New File" does nothing..

Its supposed to work that way, erasing old work.  Clarify
the docs or change the menu entry name.

9) For SGI Irix, mystery core dump when creating submenus ...
   related to menu initialization complaints with sgi compiler.
   ??? fixed ???

10) cleared balances are incorrectly shown for stock accounts

12) all messages should be moved out so that translation to foreign
    languages would be possible.
    -- long messages now in include/main.h, short words are not.

13) transfer window should allow share prices to be entered;
    but these should grey out when dealing with ordinary bank accounts.

15) Allow an account to be designated as a double-entry-only account.

16) QuickFill doesn't work with some window managers

17) Cells lose focus with some window managers.

18) add (none) to transfer list, or explain that a second selection 
    will clear it.

19) verify that tabbing works for mutualfunds and for ledgers

20) fix quickfill for ledgers.

21) add "number of shares" to XferWindow

22) add automatic interest computation

23) add mortgages, bonds

24) show example of how to do household assets

25) provide menu item to create automaticly a default set
    of accounts for business, home use.

26) provide user-default menu, to disable listing of zero-balance 
    accounts

27) add reports

28) add graphs; use code from xinvest for this?

29) add short-cut menu-icon bar

30) add icons for minimuzation

31) move resources out of main.c into a resource file.
    This requires fixing install first.

32) make instqall should work.

Fixed bugs:

> 0) For SGI Irix, 
> Xbae-4.6.2-linas/src/Matrix.h:
>   - Uncomment lines 225 and 269  ( XmNtextField & XmCTextField
>                                    definitions )
Probably fixed with XmVersion work ...

should be fixed by configure

> 4)  Selecting "File", "Open File" and then clicking "Cancel" causes

fixed.

> 5)  Tried to create a file with "touch new.dat"; when I tried to open
>     this file xacc complained that it was both too old, and too new :)
>     Oh well, didn't really expect this to work anyways..  But it would

fixed.

> 6)  The "About", "Help", and "License" windows start much too small.  I
>     need to resize them to see any text.
fixed

> 7)  "Help", "Help" shows three links to "Creating a new account".
>     Only the first does anything at all, and it just goes to the
>     "License" information.  Sometimes I need to resize this window
>     before I can use the scrollbar.
fixed.

8) tab-traversing  doesn't work for mutual, stock funds
should work now.

11) stock portfolio should indicate total $ amount of transaction
