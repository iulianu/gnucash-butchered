# POTFILES.in: This file is overwritten my the `make pot` target or by
# the make-gnucash-potfiles script.  
# 
# The reason why we version-control this generated file is because the
# Makefile in this directory is not under our control (but instead
# gettext's) and it doesn't contain any rules for creating this
# file. The gettext setup assumes by convention that this file exists
# and doesn't need to be generated, so as long as we use the gettext
# build system in the po directory, we need to follow that convention.
