Notes on I18n for GnuCash
-------------------------

Please send new and updated .po files to gnucash-patches@gnucash.org.

To update the .pot file for GnuCash it is best to simply build the
sources using 'make'. Don't run xgettext by hand, because many of the
translatable strings in GnuCash are taken from scheme files and will
be missed.

GnuCash .pot files contain some strings of the form:

sample:<some text>
Reconciled:R
reconciled:y
not cleared:n
cleared:c
frozen:f

In each of the cases above, the translator should only translate the
portion after the ':' and leave the rest as is. In the cases of single
letters (such as reconciled:y), the letters are abbreviations of the
word before the colon. The 'sample:' items are strings which are not
displayed, but only used to estimate widths.
