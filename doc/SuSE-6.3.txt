How to install gnucash-1.3.0 on SuSE-6.3
========================================

Notes:

- This is only one way to get GnuCash running on SuSE 6.3. I did test
  that, but there might be errors anyway, and of course you do all at
  your own risk. If you find errors, you might report them to the
  gnucash mailing list (gnucash-devel@gnucash.org)

- This is definitely for SuSE 6.3 (Intel). Earlier SuSE distributions
  lack some required packages. Later SuSE distributions didn't exist
  at the time of writing.
  NOTE: You can install new packages to older versions of SuSE from
        CD or ftp.suse.de or ftp.suse.com

- This howto is primarily intended for compiling from source.
  If you install the rpm, you don't need the various dev packages
  and you don't need g-wrap. (However, you won't see this howto
  until you installed the GnuCash rpm succesfully ;-).)

Let's go:

* Make sure you have a running system, including X. For my tests I
  started with a default installation and removed some packages to
  save diskspace.

* Install the following packages:
  + from series d
       eperl  guile  nana  swig  xmhtml  xmhtmld gettext
       libxml libxmld
    and optionally
       autoconf  automake  libtool
    (You must install libtool if you have autoconf/automake
    installed!) 
  + from series x
       xdevel
  + from series xdev
       lesstiff  lesstifd
  + from series gnm
       gnlibs gnlibsd
    for (check) printing
       gnprint gnprintd
  + from series gra
       imlib imlibdev

* Download slib from
    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/jacal/slib2c7.zip
  and install it by unpacking it to /usr/share/guile (this will
  create a sub-directory slib):
    cd /usr/share/guile
    su root -c "unzip -L /tmp/slib2c7"

* Download g-wrap from
    ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/g-wrap/g-wrap-0.9.1..tar.gz
  unpack and untar, then
  ./configure, make, su, make install

* Download GnuCash from
    http://www.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/sources/unstable/1.3.x/1.3.0/gnucash-1.3.0.tar.gz
  and unpack it
    tar xzf gnucash-1.3.0.tar.gz
* Alternatively get GnuCash from cvs
    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.gnucash.org:/home/cvs/cvsroot login (password guest)
    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.gnucash.org:/home/cvs/cvsroot checkout gnucash

* Configure, build and install gnucash. Installation must probably be
  done as root, the files go to various places in /usr/local.

    cd gnucash-1.3.0
    ./configure
    make motif    for motif version  or
    make gnome    for gnome version (recommended)  or
    make qt       for qt/KDE version (pre alpha, may even not compile)
    su root -c "make install"

* You may need to run GnuCash once as root, because guile needs to set up
  some things for slib. Alternatively you can try as root:
    guile -c '(use-modules (ice-9 slib)) (require 'new-catalog)'
