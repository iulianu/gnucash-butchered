    <h1>Reconciliation Window</h1>

    <p>The Reconciliation window is used to reconcile your GnuCash accounts
    with statements that banks or other institutions send you.</p>

    <p>For example, when you write a check for something, you
    should enter the transaction into GnuCash.  The reconciliation (R)
    field of the transaction will initially contain 'n' (not reconciled).
    Later, if you think that the check has been cashed, you might click on
    the transaction's R field to change it to 'c' (cleared, but not
    reconciled).</p> 

    <p>At the end of the month, you receive your bank statement,
    perhaps including canceled checks. At <em>that</em> point, you
    should "reconcile" the account, that is, match your personal
    records with the documentation provided by the bank.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Open the reconcile window by selecting 'Reconcile...' from the
      'Accounts' menu of the account's <a href="xacc-regwin.html">Register
      window</a>.  GnuCash will prompt you for some information from the
      statement:</p>
      <p><img src="recninfo.gif"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Enter the date of the end of the period that the statement covers,
      and the final balance from the statement, and press 'OK'.</p>
      <p>The Reconcile window will pop-up. The reconcile window looks
      like this:</p>

      <p>
      <img src="recnwin.gif">
      </p>

      <p>The 'Funds In' and 'Funds Out' groups lists all the unreconciled
      transactions.  The '?' columns show whether the transactions have
      been cleared or reconciled.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Now, examine each item on the statement.

	<p>Look for the matching item in the Reconcile window.  If you
	cannot find one, then perhaps you forgot to enter a transaction, or
	did not know that the transaction had happened.  You can use the
	'New' button on the tool bar, or the 'New' menu item in the
	'Transaction' menu, to open a register window and enter the missing
	transaction.  The new item will appear in the Reconcile window when
	you press 'enter' after entering the transaction.</p>
	  
	<p>When you find the item in the Reconcile window, compare the
	amount to the amount on the statement.  If they disagree, you may
	have made an error when you entered the transaction in GnuCash.
	You can use the 'Edit' button on the tool bar, or the 'Edit' menu
	item in the 'Transaction' menu, to open a register window and
	correct the transaction.</p>

	<p>If the amounts agree, click on the item in the Reconcile
	window. The '?' column will change to 'y' (reconciled) from 'n' or
	'c'.</p>

        <p>You then repeat this for each item that appears on the
        bank statement, verifying that the amounts match with the
        amounts in GnuCash, and marking off transactions in GnuCash
        as they are reconciled.</p>
      </li>

      <li>At the bottom of the window is a difference field, which
      should be 0 when you are done reconciling. If it isn't,
      then you have either missed transactions, or some amounts may
      be incorrect in GnuCash. (Or, probably rather less likely,
      the bank may have made an error.)
      </li>

      <li>When you have completed marking off all the items on the
      bank statement, and when the difference is 0, you
      may press the Finish button on the tool bar, or select the 'Finish'
      item from the 'Reconcile' menu.  The Reconcile window will close.  In
      the Register window, the R field of the reconciled transactions will
      change to 'y'.
      </li>
    </ul>
