  <img src="report-av-baln.gif>
    <p>This report allows you to track the balance of an account over time.  
    If you have gnuplot installed, it can even produce graphical output:</p>
    <img src="bal-graph.gif">
    <p>Parameters for this report include:</p>
    <ul><li>The start and end dates of the accounting period.</li>
        <li>The length of each "step", or interval in the account period.</li>
        <li>The accounts for which the report is to be produced.  If more 
            than one account is selected, the sum of all balances of accounts
            selected is used <em>NB: Could somebody make sure this is right?</em>
        <li>Which aspect of the report is to be graphed.  
            There are three graphs available:
           <ul><li>Average Balance during interval</li>
               <li>Net Gain/Loss over interval</li>
               <li>Gains and losses over interval</li></ul></ul>
