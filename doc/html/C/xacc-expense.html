    <title>Using Expense/Income Accounts</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>What are Incomes and Expenses?</h1>

    <p> The words "Income" and "Expense" are beguilingly simple;
    everyone <em> thinks</em> they know what they mean; this <em>
    usually</em> is that <b> When I spend something, this is an
    expense, and when I get money, this is an income.</b></p>

    <p> This oversimplifies things somewhat; it is often a <em>
    good-enough</em> approximation when doing personal accounting,
    but when running a business, incomes and expenses often have be
    recognized as having occurred when some "critical event" takes
    place that may not perfectly correspond to "when cash comes in
    or goes out."</p>

    <p> For instance, companies usually have to recognize income
    <em> when the sale occurs.</em> That may mean that I have to
    recognize a $100,000 sale <em> at the moment I and the customer
    shake hands on the deal.</em></p>

    <p> Since the money hasn't come in, the sale has to be
    estimated in other way; the way this is done is to <b>
    accrue</b> a sale at that time, and in making the transaction
    balance, rather than adding something in to cash, I'd add the
    $100,000 sale to <b> Accounts Receivable.</b></p>

    <p> In a double entry system, two kinds of accounts must be
    created: some of type "Income" and others of type "Expense."
    (There tend to be a lot more different kinds of expenses than
    there are of incomes.)</p>

    <p> Income such as salary, wages, bank interest and stock
    dividends are then recorded as transfers from an income account
    to a bank (or, in general, some asset) account. Similarly,
    expenses are recorded as transfers from a credit card account
    (or, in general, a liability account).</p>

    <p> Another way of describing the requirement for "double
    entry" is that when you receive an income, two things
    happen:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You receive a sum of <em> money,</em> and must record
      that effect on your bank account.</li>

      <li>You have received an income, and must record that effect
      on an income account.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> When, for instance, salary is deposited in a bank account,
    the bank account is credited, and the income account is
    debited, thus:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Account</th>

        <th>Debit</th>

        <th>Credit</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Chequing Account</td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Salary</td>

        <td>
        </td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This may be readily extended to a greater number of "split"
    items thus:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Account</th>

        <th>Debit</th>

        <th>Credit</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Chequing Account</td>

        <td>1,300.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Income Taxes</td>

        <td>200.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Health Plan</td>

        <td>100.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Salary</td>

        <td>
        </td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p> There may be a whole lot more than two entries in the
    transaction, but the total sum of the Debits, $1,600.00, still
    equals the total sum of the credits, $1,600.00.</p>

    <p> If, as with <b>GnuCash,</b> everything is forced onto one
    column, so that <b> debits</b> are represented by positive
    values, and <b> credits</b> are represented by negative values,
    the income/expense accounts do a slightly non-intuitive thing
    and you see incomes as <em> negative</em> values. That <em>
    appears</em> contrary to intuition, but is nonetheless
    necessary in order for the <a href="xacc-double.html#IDENTITY">
    double-entry bookkeeping identity  to hold true.</a></p>

    <p> Another way in which income and expense accounts are
    special is that their account totals do not directly appear on
    a balance sheet. A balance sheet shows "Net Worth": the sum of
    all assets minus all liabilities.</p>

    <p> Income and expenses are neither assets nor liabilities, and
    so do not appear on the balance sheet. What appears on the
    balance sheet is their effects on <b> equity.</b></p>

    <p> There is a separate report, a "Profit and Loss" (P&amp;L)
    report, to analyze income and expenses. The total profit (or
    loss) is calculated as total income less total expenses. In a
    nicely symmetrical fashion, since assets and liabilities are
    neither income or expenses, <em> they</em> correspondingly do
    not appear on a P&amp;L statement.</p>

    <p> Even though these accounts may be somewhat "special", you
    do not need to do anything particularly special to use income
    and expense accounts. GnuCash handles the values automatically,
    so that if you record properly the effects of the transactions
    on your bank account or credit card, the income/expense side of
    the transaction should also be handled correctly.</p>

    <p> The time when things get "peculiar," and when you need to
    more deeply understand this, is when amounts are transferred
    between income/expense accounts. (The <i> causes</i> for such
    transfers tend to be somewhat peculiar, so it's pretty fair for
    this to be a pretty odd situation.)</p>

    <h1>Using Income/Expense Accounts</h1>

    <p> To use an income/expense account, simply create one from
    the "New Account" dialogue window, and then be sure to transfer
    income/expenses to it as you record paychecks, interest,
    etc.</p>

    <p> You will doubtless wish to create quite a number of income
    and expense accounts; it may be worth looking at the <a href= 
    "xacc-groups.html#SAMPLECHART"> Sample Chart of Accounts</a>
    for ideas.</p>

    <p> This partitioning of incomes and expenses is likely to
    prove particularly useful for North Americans when <i>income
    tax time</i> rolls around.</p>
