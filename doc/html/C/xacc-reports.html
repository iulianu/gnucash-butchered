    <h1>Reports</h1>

    <p>A variety of financial reports can be selected on the
    "Extensions" menu":</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="xacc-balsheet.html">Balance Sheet:</a>shows
      Assets, Liabilities and Equity.</li>

      <li><a href="xacc-pnl.html">Profit And Loss State:</a>shows
      Income and expenses over a selectable period <em>well, it
      will when I get around to adding period support</em></li>

      <li><a href="xacc-trans_report.html">Transaction
      Report</a>shows transactions in an account, presented in a
      variety of ways.</li>

      <li><a href="xacc-bal_tracker.html">Balance Tracker</a>
      tracks the balance of one or more accounts over time, and
      supports graphical output (if you have gnuplot
      installed).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The Report Window</h1>
    Once you select a report, a report window will appear: 

    <p><img src="reportwin.gif"></p>

    <p>The report is displayed in a resizable, scrollable window.
    To control the report, you can use the toolbar buttons at the
    top of the window:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Back</b> and <b>Forward</b> allow you to view the
      previous contents of the window, just like a web browser</li>

      <li>
        <b>Parameters</b> pops up a dialog box allowing you to
        change the information presented in the report: 

        <p><img src="report-option.gif"></p>

        <p>See the help for the individual reports for details of
        options available.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Export</b> allows you to export the contents of the
      report as a HTML file for later viewing or printing.</li>

      <li><b>Close</b> closes the report window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Constructing custom reports</h1>
    It is possible to write your own reports to meet your own
    needs, if you can program a little. You will need to know
    Scheme (a LISP-like programming language), and it is an
    excellent idea to have a copy of the Gnucash source code
    available. 

    <p>The reporting interface is presently undocumented, but you
    can get a good idea of how it works by examining the file
    src/scm/report/hello-world.scm in the GnuCash source
    distribution.</p>

    <p>You will also need to access data from the "engine" to get
    information for your report. This is performed by a set of
    Scheme wrapper functions that are documented in the file
    src/g-wrap/gnc.html. You may wish to examine some of the other
    reports in src/scm/report for an indication of how they are
    used.</p>

    <p>At present, reports are produced by internally creating HTML
    and rendering this with a HTML widget. (Future versions of
    GnuCash will hopefully support a more flexible system).</p>

    <p>If you need more information, or have developed a new report
    that may be of use to others, please contact the GnuCash
    development mailing list at <a href=
    "mailto:gnucash-devel@gnucash.org">
    gnucash-devel@gnucash.org</a>.</p>
