    <h1>GnuCash Project Goals</h1>

    <p> The people behind <a href="http://gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> aim
    to create a world-class GPL'ed Open Source Personal Financial
    Application for GNU/Linux and other Unix's. This page reviews
    some of the technical issues and development status surrounding
    this project.  It is a kind of an <b>FAQ</b> for developers and
    contributors, providing status, and suggesting directions and 
    technologies for deploying new features.

    If you simply want to get a better idea of what 
    <a href="http://gnucash.org">
    GnuCash</a> is and what it does, visit its <a href=
    "http://gnucash.org">home page</a>.  The home page contains
    screen shots, news items, and mailing list archives.

    <p>There are currently several different versions of
    GnuCash.  We've adopted the kernel numbering scheme: 
    even minor relase numbers (1.2.x, 1.4.x) are considered to mark
    stable releases, while odd numbers (1.3.x) mark development 
    releases.

    <ul>
      <li>The current stable, production release is gnucash-1.2.5
          and is based on the Open Group's Motif GUI library.
          Note, however, that the Motif version is no longer being
          maintained, and all development efforts have switched over 
          to the Gnome/GTK version.
          
      <br><br>
      <li>The 1.3.x releases focus on the 
      the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> /
      <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a> version.
      This version adds many new features that are absent in the Motif
      version.  Development is progressing well, and the 1.3.x series
      are as usable as the 1.2.5 version.

      <br><br>
      <li>Note that some more experimental versions, such as one
      using the <a href="http://www.troll.no/products/qt.html">Qt
      library from Troll Tech</a> for the for the <a href= 
      "http://www.kde.org/">KDE desktop</a>, for the Palm Computing
      platforms, as well as a Java-based version have been
      discussed and/or started.  Source code for these, such as there
      may be, is in the CVS tree.
      
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The latest Gnome version, and latest versions in general,
    are currently available only via CVS.  Occasionally, some of the
    more stable CVS versions are given a version number, and packaged 
    as a precompiled deb or rpm install package.  

    Naive or begining users should probably stick to version 
    gnucash-1.2.5: although this version is quite old and lacking in
    many features, it is known to work.   More adventurous users can try 
    one of the 1.3.x releases:  these days, they are pretty stable, and
    work pretty well.  However, we cannot gaurentee that they are
    flawless.  We've tried to make sure that no matter how broken
    these get, they won't mangle your data, but we can't make promises.

    <a name="arch"> 
    <h1>Architectural Goals</h1>
    There are some over-reaching design principles
    and philosophies that we intend to maintain. Some of these
    concepts and terms are introduced in this section.</a> 

    <h2>Separation of GUI and Data</h2>
    First, we must maintain a clean separation between the data
    structures and the GUI that manipulates them, along the lines
    of the <b>Model-View-Controller</b> paradigm. 

    <ul>
      <li>Lists of accounts and the transactions in them can be
      thought of as a representation of financial data, a <b>
      Model</b>.</li>

      <li>
        The GUI that adds, modifies and deletes these should be
        thought of as a manipulator of the data, a <b>
        Controller</b>. 

        Thus, the Motif or Gnome GUIs are merely two possible
        manipulators of the data; others, based on <i>e.g.</i>
        web/cgi-bin, Qt/KDE, emacs, Java applets or Java servlets 
        ought to be possible.
      </li>

      <li>The <b>View</b> of the data is a subset or slice of the
      data described by the Model. The View may consist of only the
      transactions for the month of May, or only the account totals
      for certain accounts. The View is used in part to generate
      the reports and graphs, but it is also that which the
      Controller interacts with. Views are generated by queries
      to the data store.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> GnuCash also needs to deal with multiple distributed data
    sources: stock quotations from the net or transaction
    confirmations from online banks and brokerage houses, or from
    more mundane sources, such as file imports, or merger of data
    from several users.

    Amongst these terms, the concept of a global Model-View is
    dated, and somewhat inappropriate. Rather, we need to be
    concerned about how data is represented in the local address
    space of the GUI, how the GUI manipulates it, how data is
    brought in and merged from external sources, and how that data
    is again output, whether to a file or a local or remote
    database.</p>

    <p> Thus, the <b> View</b> essentially represents a local data
    cache of the data that is immediately present and being
    displayed, reported, and manipulated. The <b> Model</b> is the
    abstraction of that data that the GUI (the controller) can act
    on.</p>

    <h2>The Financial Engine</h2>
    In GnuCash, the Model is implemented via the <b>Engine</b> API,
    and the View is the data that is currently in the <b>
    Engine</b>. Thus, the Engine is a set of programming API's that
    the GUI (or a script, or even a clever command-line-addict) can
    use to manipulate the data. 

    <p> Currently, the Engine is fairly poor, and is tightly tied
    to the data structures that the GUI manipulates. These data
    structures include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Transactions</b>, which consist of a set of journal entries
          (JE's) whose values sum to zero.

      <li><b>Journal Entries</b> (internally refered to as 'splits')
          which record prices and values.

      <li><b>Accounts</b>, which consist of a list of journal entries.

      <li><b>Chart of Accounts</b>, which is a heirarchical tree of
          accounts.
    </ul>
    The Engine has a very simple apply/commit model, and a simple
    query mechanism for generating reports and views.  The goal of the 
    commit and query model is to aid/simplify the creation of & merger
    with an SQL back-end.

    <p> The Engine currently handles only a small set of data
    sources:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It can import and merge in QIF's;</li>

      <li>It can read and write its own binary byte stream;</li>

      <li>It can get stock quotes from the net.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> However, since the Engine is meant to be the interface
    between the GUI and the financial data, it is really intended
    to be able to do much more.</p>

    <p> In particular, it should be possible to back the Engine
    onto an SQL database, and thereby enable multiple users and/or
    interface to more complex accounting systems. The engine should
    also be expandable to handle other sources of data, such as
    OFX, Integrion GOLD, the Open Trading Protocol, the OMG CORBA
    General Ledger submission, the IBM San Francisco business
    objects, or closer to home, Linux Kontor. In particular, it
    should be possible to use GnuCash not only to view data from
    these sources, but also to manipulate it and send it back.</p>

    <h2>Modularity, Extensibility and Customization</h2>

    <p> The above structure should leads us to view GnuCash not so
    much as a tightly integrated application, but rather as a loose
    confederation of component objects, libraries and
    interfaces.

    In order to facilitate the gluing together of these parts,
    as well as simplify the questions of customizability, change
    and rapid development, GnuCash makes use of the
    <a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/index.html">
    Scheme</a> extension language (as implemented in the FSF 
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a>
    interpreter), to glue the pieces together.
    (Note that the engine interface is also available with 
    <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> interfaces, thanks
    to a 
    <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/beazley/swig.html">
    SWIG</a> wrapper.
    </p>

<a name="reqs">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
    Implicit in this desire for extensibility is the need to build
    financial applications supporting two major classes of users: 
</a> 

    <ul>
      <li>Home Users</li>

      <li>Small Business Users</li>
    </ul>
    They may use some of the same financial terminology, and
    hopefully might share a fair bit of code, but have quite
    different goals and requirements. 

    <h3> Personal Finance Needs</h3>

    <p> Important properties of a personal finance system
    include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Needs to be approachable and usable by occasional users 
      who are not knowledgeable about accounting.</li>

      <li>Ease of use and simplicity is critical.</li>

      <li>A reasonable selection of reports, graphs,
      charts, and tools for personal finance, such as mortgage
      calculations.</li>

      <li>Budgeting support needs to be targeted at <em> naive</em>
      users.</li>

      <li>Interfaces to on-line banking, shopping, stock
      systems.</li>

      <li>Support for management of stock portfolios that may
      involve considerable sophistication, since individuals
      commonly have retirement plans that hold mutual funds,
      stocks, options, bonds, and the like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Small Business Needs</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>With a business system, it is likely that there will be
      full-time users, which puts the emphasis on <em>
      efficiency</em> of user interface rather than on its
      approachability to naive users.</li>

      <li>Business systems require network support, and the ability
      to support multiple simultaneous users.</li>

      <li>Some business users may want access to the system from an
          MS Windows 95/98/NT box.  For these folks, a web-based
          interface could be just handy.  Web interfaces are also 
          nice for ASP type deployment.
      <li>
        Small businesses do not often have sophisticated investment
        portfolios; they instead need support for additional
        sophistication in such areas as: 

        <ul>
          <li>Payroll</li>

          <li>Inventory Control</li>

          <li>Shipping and Receiving</li>

          <li>Accounts Receivable</li>

          <li>Accounts Payable</li>

          <li>Asset Management</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Support for calculations associated with accrual
      accounting.</li>

      <li>Ambitions for the future might include interfaces to
      online shopping carts, credit card clearing interfaces, and
      ERP systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Reconciling Those Needs</h3>

    <p> A seemingly contradictory factor is that the kinds of
    sophistication that are required vary considerably.
    Consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A home user does not generally require most of the
        sophistication (sophistry?) of accrual accounting that is
        required by business enterprises. 
        Thus, home users don't need <em> much</em> of the
        sophistication of an Accounts Receivable or Payable system,
        or the <em> bizarre</em> depreciation policies that crop up
        in Asset Management systems.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        On the other hand, home users are in increasing need of
        surprisingly sophisticated financial tools for managing
        stock portfolios, including: 

        <ul>
          <li>Mutual funds</li>

          <li>Retirement savings plans, with such identifiers as
          401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, RRSP</li>

          <li>Corporate stock purchase plans</li>

          <li>Corporate option plans</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Another set of contradictory requirements has to do with the
    back-end, and interfacing to other systems:
    <ul>
    <li>Home users need a simple-to-install, simple-to-maintain system.
        This essentially rules out the use of SQL for the storage
        medium/back-end for home users.  (That is, the current state
        of the art for SQL on Linux does not offer any simple,
        fool-proof management for data).
    <li>By contrast, non-SQL systems for business use are almost
        unimaginable.   SQL provides a high degree of data integrity
        and storage robustness, and also simplifies tremendously the
        import and export of data.  Powerful SQL tools exist that can
        work magic in the hands of a good DB admin.
    </ul>

    <p> It may be that these will require <em> completely</em>
    different systems, and that GnuCash cannot be "all things to
    all people." This remains to be seen.</p>

<h1>Features and Functions</h1>
This section reviews the current status of various features.
Some of these are 'in process', some are 'almost done', some are
'completely done'.  This section thus provides status on both where
we've been, and where we're going.

      <dt><b>Internationalization</b></dt>

      <dd>
        All menus, markup and help-text should be
        internationalized, so that GnuCash may be usable in any
        country. This would include the printing of currency values
        in the local country conventions. 

        <p> <b>Current status:</b>

        <ul>
          <li>All GUI messages currently use GNU <tt>gettext()</tt> for 
              the message catalogs.  Translations exist for 
              English, British, French, Sweedish and German.</li>

          <li>Help pages available only in English and French.

          <li>Monetary and string handling done through glibc.
              The latest glibc (2.2.3) is nedded to get the correct
               functions.

          <li>Yannick Le Ny &lt;y-le-ny@ifrance.com&gt; traduction
               en francais</li>
          <li>Most GUI input elements use the gtk text widget, and 
              thus use the XIM input method in asian locales. This
              allows e.g. Kanji, Katakana support. However, the 
              register does *not* use XIM, and thus doesn't currently
              support the asian languages.  This needs fixing.

      <dd>
        A variety of reports, including Net Worth, Balance
        Sheets, and Profit and Loss statements. These should be
        printable: that is, exportable as HTML as well as print-ready
        postscript. 
        These should be easy to customize. Ideally, even novice users
        should be able to create custom reports.

        <p> The Report Generator should be a separate but
        "dockable" subsystem of the whole.
        That is, it should be possible to run the report generator
        in a stand-alone, read-only fashion without having to start
        up the main application. It should be possible to run reports
        nightly from a command-line and/or cron job.</p>

        <p> One difficult aspect of reporting is designing a
        configurable interface, so that people can build custom
        reports. The <a href="xacc-reports.html#NEWREP"> New
        Reporting Infrastructure</a> is seeking to build this up
        using Guile.</p>

        <p>Generated reports should be exportable to other gnome
        systems using bonbo.  Reports should also be exportable to 
        the gnumeric spreadsheet (possibly by writing out gnumeric 
        file format??)

        <p>Reports should make use of the 'action' field ...</p>

          <li>A general reporting infrastrucutre was implemented in 
              Perl, in the form of html-embedded perl (ePerl).  
              However, this reporting mechanism was abondoned 
              in part because ongoing build and install problems related
              to eperl and swig. Also, since eperl didn't poarticipate
              in the interpreter even loop, the report generator
              had to runn as a separate process, reading data via pipes.
              This was uglier than some folks liked.

        Ability to close the book at end of the fiscal year. 
        This consists of several steps:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Permanently lock some transactions as
        non-editable. This should be straight-forward by using the
        <tt>reconciled</tt> field to indicate a <tt>locked</tt>
        value, and not allowing the GUI to edit locked records.
        <li>Transfer the Income minus Expense for the book period
            to an equity account, so that each new period starts with
            zero income/expense balances.

            From this last, we conclude that every chart of accounts

        The application is wired together partly with C, partly

        is fit in needs to be reviewed, with a general overview
        created so that additional extensions may be added in a
        straightforward manner. 

        <p> The overall architecture is envisioned thus:</p>

        <p> All code, including the transaction engine, the file
        I/O routines, the menus, and the ledger, will be abstracted
        into compact modules that can function independently of
        each other. At the highest level, there will be a
        infrastructure with extension language interfaces that will
        "wire together" the various modules.</p>

        <p> Such "wiring together" will consist of a dispatch
        infrastructure that will allow arbitrary menu entries to be
        hooked to arbitrary modules. The configuration for menu
        entries, and their associated callbacks, will be specified
        in an extension-language configuration file. At the final
        stages, it is <em> highly</em> desirable to be able to, in

        Add ability to download historical prices as well. (e.g.
        get 5-year history of mutual fund performance vs. djia). 
        <p>
        Right now, stock prices are stored with everything else,
        in the main database, in the transaction table.  This leads
        to several aesthetic quandries.  It bulks up the database
        with 'less-than critical' information.  Basically, transactions
        are either 'critical' vix record the movement of money, or
        are non-critical viz record things retreivable from the 
        historical record, e.g. prices.  Shouldn't storage for 
        prices be moved to somewhere else?  Hmmm ...  what about
        storage for valatility, shares traded, etc?  Does indeed sound
        like an alternate storage method would be useful.  What about GUI
        implications?

        Provide the SGML DTD parsers to handle the OFX reports that
        many banking institutions are providing, or will soon be
        providing, to retail customers. See below for OFX
        references. 

        OFX is an open spec from Microsoft, Intuit, and
        Checkfree, and which will be supported by Integrion. The
        OFX DTD's are included in the 1.1 distributions. See <a
        href="http://www.ofx.net">OFX Home Page</a> for
        details.

        <p> There are two ways to build an OFX parser. One way is
        to build a compile-time DTD parser that treats the DTD as
        if it were an IDL, and generates C language stubs for a
        parser.
        This approach was attempted and abandoned because it
        leads to fragile C code and a very large binary.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The parser is fragile because minor DTD
          non-compliances are hard to parse, handle and recover
          from.</li>

          <li>The parser is huge because the DTD results in
          hundreds of (C++) objects being generated.</li>
        </ul>
        The other method would be to perform run-time DTD parsing.
        This is attractive particularly because it is a more
        commonly-used approach; there are a variety of XML tools
        available that provide this function. 

        <p> Run-time parsing may be slower, but on the OFX client
        side, this should not be a bottleneck.</p>

        <p> <b>Status:</b>

        <ul>
          <li>A compile-time parser was developed and
          abandoned.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p> Note that the organizations developing OFX are looking
        to use XML as their "formats of the future;" this may
        encourage the use of one of the many XML parsers available
        for UNIX.

        Need to support multiple currencies. Work is needed in the
        GUI. The engine currently supports multiple
        currencies by treating them as securities, and thus
        allowing currency trading. The currency-trading register
        needs a complete overhaul.   (Its obtuse and unintuitive).
        <p>
        A simplfied way of dealing with one-shot currency exahnges needs
        to be implemented. basically, just a simple calculator popup.

      <p>
      <dt><a name="double"><b>Forced Double-Entry</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        The system supports double-entry: every transaction
        indicates a pair of accounts: one is debited, and one is
        credited. 

        <p> Double-entry is a powerful way of ensuring the
        integrity of of the financial data. Currently, while
        double-entry is supported, its use is not enforced: the
        user <em>can</em> create dangling transactions, where only
        one account is indicated.</p>

        <p>Although this is acceptable for home use (even
        desirable, since it allows the casual user the simplicity
        they desire), it is not acceptable for business use.</p>

        <p> It must be possible to enable forced-double entry, so
        that a transaction cannot be completed until two accounts
        have been specified.</p>

        <p> <b>Current status:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>April 1998 -- The engine has a couple of flags in it
          that control double-entry behavior: it can be made lax,
          or strict: however, they are compiled in, there is no way
          to change them from the GUI.</li>

          <li>Dec 1998 -- Scrubber functions implemented to crawl
          through data, and find all unbalanced or orphaned
          transactions.</li>

        People <em>like</em> to be able to read file contents in

        ASCII equivalent of the current file format should be easy
        to develop ... just substitute the writes with <tt>
        printf()</tt>s. 

        <p>The tab-delimited format should be compatible with that
        of <tt>/rdb</tt>, aka <a href= 
        "ftp://ftp.rand.org/pub/RDB-hobbs/"> RAND/Hobbs /rdb</a> or

        "http://www.debian.org"> Debian GNU/Linux</a> distribution,

        <p> The <tt>/rdb</tt> format is thus:</p>

      <dd>
        The current system makes a distinction between the data
        (account, transaction) and they GUI that displays it. The
        data is embedded within and controlled by the "Engine",
        which is a set of routines to access accounts,
        transactions, etc. The engine serves as a kind of a dynamic
        cache between the permanent data repository (file, sql db)
        and the GUI. 

        <p> The current engine is rather simple: it provides
        support for accounts, account hierarchies and transactions
        consisting of multiple entries.</p>

        <p>Many of the features described elsewhere will require
        that the engine have a far richer, more sophisticated data
        model, including such things as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Linking to "Address Info" (<em> e.g.</em> names,
          addresses)</li>

          <li>Transaction identifiers</li>

          <li>Part numbers, SKU IDs</li>

          <li>Interest rates</li>

          <li>Budget policy</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Note: it makes no sense at this point to make the
        engine API much richer than what the GUI can currently
        support.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Locks</b> When splits are implemented, and the
          parent transaction has been marked as cleared, the record
          should be locked, so that further modifications to the
          amount can't be performed (or at least, a warning is
          generated. This prevents accidental garbaging up of old
          transactions.)</li>

          <li>
            <b>Books</b> Ability to close a book at the end of the
            fiscal year, thus indicating that nobody is permitted
            to "mess around" with that old data. 

            <p> In a business environment, the auditors may have
            "signed off" on the validity of the data; at that
            point, the ability to modify audited data should be
            <em> very</em> tightly controlled, or even downright
            forbidden.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p> <b>Current Status:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>The basic engine has been detangled from the GUI
          elements, as of version gnucash-1.1.4.</li>

          <li>Binary file I/O mostly detangled into a separate
          module.</li>

          <li>Crude transaction logging in place; should be
          suitable for error/crash recovery but has not been "tried

          <li>

            routines mostly in place, 

            <p> These "Transaction processing constructs" should
            simplify creation of an SQL back end, or some other
            more sophisticated database engine.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Multiple currency support is present but still pretty
          "raw."</li>

        A module is necessary to allow data to be fetched from an
        SQL database, and for that database to be updated. 

        <p> There has been <em> much</em> discussion about this on
        mailing lists both for GnuCash and <a href= 
        "http://www.menet.umn.edu/~curt/cbb/"> CBB.</a> Major
        points have included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Those SQL databases available on Linux tend to involve
            considerable <em> administrative</em> overhead in terms
            of getting them set up. 
            This may be a minor cost to a business enterprise
            that hires DataBase Administrators.</p>
            It is <em> not</em> acceptable to require this of
            naive users that may find "simple" things like</p>
<pre>
% su -
Password:
# cd /tmp
# rpm -i gnucash-4.1.3.i386.rpm
# exit
</pre>
            to be challenging.
          </li>

          <li>It might be useful to use an embedded
          database engine like unto <a href= 
          "http://www.sleepycat.com/"> Sleepycat DB</a>, <a href= 
          "ftp://koobera.math/uic.edu/www.cdb.html"> cdb,</a> or
          something like <a href= 
          "http://www.opengroup.org/public/prods/dmm4.htm">
          ISAM</a> (Note CQL++ supports ISAM access methds), 
          or even an embedded SQL engine such as 
          <a href="http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/gigabase.html">GigaBASE</a>.
          The point of doing so would be to to provide a uniform,
          more-easily-extensible, more portable interface to the data.
          </li>

          <li>
            GnuCash presently uses a document-oriented model, where
            the <em>entire</em> set of books are loaded in, and
            dumped out, all at one fell swoop. 
            GnuCash needs to be modified to access the database in a
            transactional manner.  This at least partly implemented
            with the Begin()/End() constructs in the engine.
            <p>
        Some transactional thoughts: entire SQL tables/databases 
        do not need to be locked while the user is editing a transaction
        via the GUI.
        Instead, an optimistic approach, similar to that
        employed by CVS (concurrent version system, a mechanism for
        storing versions of source code) could be used: if the
        edits conflict with changes made by others, the edit could
        be rejected en-masse, allowing the user to merge and
        correct their changes. This is a very important note:
        updating SQL does NOT require locks to be held for long
        periods of time! 

           <li>
The SQL engine chosen should be fully transactional, passing the 'ACID'
test (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  
Note that <a href="http://openacs.org/why-not-mysql.html">MySQL 
doesn't pass the 'ACID' test</a>.

        web-application-server, and have users do much/most of I/O
