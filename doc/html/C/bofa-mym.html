<h1>Managing Your Money --&gt; GnuCash</h1>

I have finally put the Perl script that allowed me to use GnuCash
up on a web site. I had a couple years of data in Managing Your
Money 2.x that I didn't want to reenter. The script will output a
single QIF file with all transactions, accounts, and categories.
(Currently only non-investment transactions are handled.) The QIF
file can be imported to xacc-1.0.18 if a small patch is applied to
QIFIO.c. The site is

MyMdump</a></p>

<h1>Duplicate Transactions</h1>

I also have a script that I use to remove duplicate transactions at
the QIF level. I use this script because Xacc is very strict about
duplicates (which is good) and because editing imported
transactions will cause a re-import of the same transactions to
produce duplicates. (I download the same month's transactions from
my bank several times each month, so each downloaded QIF
file--after the first--contains transactions I have already
imported. I don't want to rely on the bank sending me the
transactions in the same order or with the same formatting.) The
site is

<p> I hope others find these scripts useful.</p>
