    <h1>Managing Your Money --&gt; GnuCash</h1>

    Ken Yamaguchi has kindly made available a Perl script that allows
    Managing Your Money 2.x data to be converted into QIF format, which
    can then be imported into GnuCash.  It has been tested with 1.3.99 and
    works well.  The script is available
    from:</P>

    <h1>Duplicate Transactions</h1>
    Ken has also written a script that removes duplicate
    transactions at the QIF level. GnuCash
    is very strict about duplicates, and this script is useful for
    successfully importing a succession of QIF files provided by a bank for
    overlapping time periods, for instance.
    This script is available from:
