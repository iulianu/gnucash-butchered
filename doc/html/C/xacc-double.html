    <title>Understanding Double Entry Accounting</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Why Use Double Entry Accounting?</h1>

    <p>If you are a novice to accounting, you <em>need</em> double
    entry accounting to help you keep your accounts straight. It
    will keep you from creating an unverifiable mess. It will make
    your life easier, and it will make this software easier to
    understand and to use.</p>

    <p>And if you are an experienced accountant, you would likely
    feel <em>ill</em> at the thought of life without it.</p>

    <h1>What is Double Entry Accounting?</h1>

    <p>Double entry bookkeeping is an accounting methodology
    introduced in the 13th century to to make sure that each
    accounts and indeed <em>each transaction</em> is properly
    balanced.</p>

    <p>When these are all required to balance, the likelihood of
    data-entry errors is greatly reduced. For large, complex sets
    of accounts with many transactions, it is distressingly easy to
    make errors that may go undetected for a long time, and be
    appallingly difficult to track down, even when double-entry
    bookkeeping is used.</p>

    <p>A double-entry transaction is a transaction that contains
    entries for two (or more) accounts that balance against one
    another. One account is <em>debited</em> by an amount exactly
    equal to what the other is <em>credited.</em> By ensuring that
    each transaction balances, a balanced set of accounts is
    guaranteed. This doesn't prevent you from having errors, but
    certainly eliminates the large class of <b>I forgot to enter
    that part of the transaction</b> errors.</p>

    <p>Double-entry may be introduced in a more intuitive way via
    the notion of a transfer from one bank account to another,
    where an amount is taken out of one bank account and deposited
    in the other. This is effectively the "rule" of double entry
    accounting; if you add something in to one account, you <em>
    have</em> to have another component to that transaction to
    balance it.</p>

    <p><b>Not-quite-an-aside:</b> If you look at your bank
    statements, they are typically written up from the <b>
    bank's</b> perspective, which is exactly <em>opposite</em> to
    yours. For instance, when you put money in, establishing a
    deposit, this establishes a <b>DEBT</b> on their part.</p>
    As a result, "newcomers to accounting," who only see the terms
    "Debit" and "Credit" on statements from their bank seem to get
    fairly confused about this. 

    <p>The perhaps less obvious extension is the notion that double
    entry can be used to represent income and expenses as well as
    bank transfers. See the <a href="xacc-expense.html">
    Income/Expense</a> page for a more detailed discussion of
    that.</p>

    <p><a name="IDENTITY">In a traditional system that records
    debits and credits separately, the identity that all
    transactions are required to satisfy is that <tt>Total of
    Debits = Total of Credits.</tt></a></p>

    <p>The fact that the identity requires merely that the <em>
    total</em> balances means that it is a little bit misleading to
    call this <em>double</em>-entry bookkeeping; it would be
    somewhat more accurate to call it <em>multiple-</em>entry
    bookkeeping. Unfortunately, there's 700 years of history of use
    of the term, which sufficiently discourages changing it. (To
    think some newcomers to UNIX think that it has some crufty old
    bits of oddness. Hah! We've got UNIX beat by the better part of
    a millennium!)</p>

    <p>GnuCash treats "Debits" as positive values, and "Credits" as
    negative values, so that this identity simplifies to <tt>
    value<sub>1</sub> + value<sub>2</sub> + value<sub>3</sub> + ...
    = 0</tt></p>

    <h1>Using Double Entry</h1>

    <h2>Creating Transactions</h2>

    <p>To create a double-entry transaction:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Click on a box in the column marked <tt>Transfer From</tt>
        on the left-hand side of the register. 

        <p>A menu will drop down, listing all of the accounts from
        which a transfer may be made.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Select one. 

        <p>When you record the transaction, the double-entry will
        automatically be made, and the transaction automatically
        appear in all windows showing the transferred-from and the
        transferred-to accounts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changing Transactions</h2>

    <p>To <em>change</em> a double-entry transaction:</p>

    <p>Simply edit the transaction in any window in which it
    appears.</p>

    <p>Any changes made will be automatically reflected in both
    accounts and all windows displaying the transaction.</p>

    <p>Similarly, when a double-entry transaction is deleted, the
    "splits" will be deleted from both accounts, and balances will
    automatically be recalculated for <em>both</em> accounts.</p>

    <p>To change the transfer account, simply select a new account
    from the pull-down menu. When you record the transaction, it
    will automatically be selected from the old account, and
    inserted into the new account.</p>

    <h1>Scrubbing Clean</h1>

    <p>GnuCash may be configured to be strict about double entry,
    or you may configure it to be "loose."</p>

    <p>In "loose" mode, you can create <em>unbalanced
    transactions,</em> that is, transactions where the "splits"
    don't balance to zero. That discards the validation that comes
    from using the more strict double entry scheme, which is
    probably not a really wise move. In effect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you aren't sure of what you're doing, you likely do
      not want to discard the validation of <b>double entry,</b> as
      this helps you keep your accounts balanced even when you're
      not perfectly clear on this.</li>

      <li>If you are an <em>accounting whiz,</em> you'll know that
      it's <em>really important</em> to keep things in balance, and
      again will prefer <b>double entry.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>But if you decide to "outsmart the system," and have a
    number of unbalanced transactions, you'll probably want to
    clean this up at some point. To clean up these unbalanced
    transactions, you <b>Scrub</b> the account clean by choosing
    <tt>Scrub</tt> from the window menu.</p>

    <p>The process will examine each transaction; if the
    transaction doesn't balance, a split entry will be created and
    placed into an account named <b>Unbalanced.</b> You may then
    review these splits and move them to their proper accounts.</p>

    <p><b>Warning: Functionality Changing...</b></p>

    <p>At present, control over whether GnuCash is "strict" or
    "loose" is established at compile time, and defaults to <b>
    strict.</b></p>

    <p>In the future, there will be no option of "looseness."</p>
