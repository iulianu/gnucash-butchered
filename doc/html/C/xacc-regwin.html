    <h1>Register Window</h1>
    <img src="regwin-single.gif">
    <p> This is the "Register" or the "Ledger" window.  Transactions are entered here.</p>
    <p>To enter a new transaction, just type into the last blank transaction.
    Use the mouse or the <a href="xacc-regwin_kbd.html">Register Keyboard Shortcuts</a>to move between fields, and hit the Enter key or click record to 
      record the transaction:</p>
    <img src="regwin-single2.gif">
    <p> Notice how a the transaction has been recorded and a new, blank 
      transaction has been created.</p>
    <p>You can edit existing transactions in a similar manner.  GnuCash
      will prompt you to confirm any changes you make.</p>

    <h1>Manipulating transactions</h1>
    <p>You can manipulate transactions with the toolbar or the "Transaction"
      menu:
      <ul><li><b>Delete:</b> you can delete a transaction or an individual
      split.</li>
      <li><b>Cancel:</b> this reverts any changes you have made to the
	transaction you are currently entering/changing</li>
      <li><b>New:</b> this moves the cursor to the last line of the
	register where new transactions are entered</li>
      <li><b>Jump:</b> When placed over an existing transaction, it takes
	you to the corresponding register entry in the other register entry 
	that this 
	transaction appears in</li>
      <li><b>Transfer:</b>This is an alternative way to enter a transaction.
	You can do a transfer between any two accounts without opening
	up other registers.</li>
      <li><b>Close:</b>Closes this register</li></ul>

    <h1>Viewing Transactions</h1>
    
    <p>The register can show transactions in a variety of different
      ways, controlled by entries on the "Register" menu.</p>
    <p>The register can display transactions in several different
      styles:</p>
      <ul><li><b>single-line mode:</b> transactions are displayed on a single line.</li>
      <li><b>double-line mode:</b> transactions are displayed over two lines,
	with more information about each transaction shown.</li>
      <li><b>multi-line mode:</b> transactions are displayed over multiple
	lines, allowing the display of multiple entries.  This allows you
	to enter multi-split transactions (for instance, when you pay multiple bills with one check).</li>
      <li><b>auto-single and auto-double modes</b> are like single and
	double-line modes, except that the currently-edited transaction
	is displayed in multi-line form.  This is a very convenient way
	of entering multi-account transactions.</li></ul>

    <p>To change the display style, to go the "Register" menu and select
      "style".</p>

    <p>Existing transactions are normally displayed in date order, but
      this can also be changed with "Sort Order".
      You can also select a date rate from which transactions will be
      displayed with "Date Range".</p>
    <h1>Reconciliation</h1>
    <p>Transactions are typically checked against bank statements - a 
      process known as "reconciliation".  GnuCash keeps track of 
      the reconciliation status of each transaction.</p>
    <p>The reconciliation status of a transaction is shown by the 
      reconciliation (R) field.  'c' indicates that a transaction 
      has been reconciled, 'n' indicates that it has not.  You can
      change the reconciliation status by clicking on a the 'r' field
      of the transaction.</p>
    <p> At the bottom of the account window, there are two running
    balances, the "cleared and reconciled" balance, and the "total"
    balance... the "cleared and reconciled" balance should
    correspond to how much money the bank thinks you have in your
    account, and the "total" balance includes outstanding
    transactions.</p>

    <p> Reconciliation can be done in the <a href=
    "xacc-recnwin.html">Reconcile Window</a></p>

 

    <h1>Stock Portfolios</h1>

    <p> You can do stock transactions either from a single-stock
    window, or from a portfolio-view window, shown below.</p>

    <p> <img src="foliowin.gif"><br>
     <img src="foliowin-single.gif"></p>

    <p> The portfolio ledger can seem a bit daunting at first
    sight.</p>

    <p> If you have trouble understanding it, then you may wish to
    create an account for each stock you wish to track.</p>

    <p> Some important points to remember about the portfolio
    window:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It shows <em>all</em> stocks in your portfolio, not just
        one. 

        <p> The share amounts shown are for each particular
        stock.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Note that it uses a two line display. 

        <p> Debited accounts and debited amounts are on the upper
        line, and credited amounts and accounts are on the lower
        line.</p>
      </li>

      <li>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the total balance will not change, since the value
      of the stock equals the amount of money exchanged.</li>

      <li>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the value of the transaction will appear twice, once
      in red, and once in black. If shares are purchased, the
      amount of money debited from the brokerage account will be in
      red, and the value of the shares in black. If shares are
      sold, then value of the shares is in red, and the money
      credited to the brokerage account in black.</li>

      <li>If you are having trouble indicating a share
      purchase/sale in the portfolio ledger, then make sure that
      <b>Transfer From</b> and <b>Transfer To</b> accounts are in
      the right order. A transfer from a stock account is always
      interpreted as a sale, even if you entered the data as a
      purchase. The vice-versa is also true.</li>

      <li>Eventually, an alternative simpler portfolio ledger
      window may be provided.</li>
    </ul>
