    <para>When a user first starts up gnucash or asks for a "New File"
    to be created from the "File" menu this druid is run to help the
    user setup a list of accounts to use.  You can disable the druid
    being shown when you choose to create a "New File" by setting the
    "No account list setup on new file" option in the "General"
    section of the  <link linkend="XACC-PREFERENCES">Preferences</link>
    dialog.</para>

    <para>The druid will be run for a new user until that user first
    uses a file, or they complete the druid, or they uncheck the box
    shown when they press "Cancel".</para>

    <para>You can press Cancel at any time to stop the druid.  Once
    done with a particular frame you press the Next button to go on to
    the next frame.  If you realize you have made a mistake or missed
    something you can press the Previous button to take you back to
    the last frame.</para>

    <para><inlinemediaobject><imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="image/new-user-frame2.png">
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></para>

      <para>On this frame you pick the currency you'd like the
      accounts to use.  This currency will be used as the default
      currency for all accounts created.  At least one of the account
      type selections includes a currency trading account.  You will
      have to go back after Finishing this druid and change the traded
      to currency in that account.</para>

      <para>On this frame you choose what types of accounts you would
      like to be setup.  Most people will want to choose the Common
      accounts.  Other categories should be pretty self
      explanatory.</para>

      <para>In the bottom right corner of the frame you can see the
      hierarchy of accounts that will be created because of this
      category.  In the bottom left corner of the frame is a longer
      description of the accounts that are a part of this type.</para>

      <para>You can choose one, more than one, or all of the
      categories.  The Select All button lets you choose all
      categories easily.  Thea Clear All button lets you clear all the
      selections.</para>

      accounts that will be created all in one list.  You can also set
      some starting balances on accounts here.</para>

      account you'd like to set and type the starting balance in the
      text box on the right.</para>
