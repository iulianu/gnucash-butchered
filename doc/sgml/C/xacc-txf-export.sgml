<PARA>The tax report allows you to export all tax related Income and Expenses
      to a <ULINK URL="http://www.turbotax.com/txf/index.html">TXF (Tax
      eXchange Format)</ULINK> file in addition to the html format that
      all reports allow. The TXF file can be imported into tax filing
      programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax.
</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS>NOTE:</EMPHASIS> For this to work, the user has to
      segregate taxable and not taxable income to different accounts, as
      well as deductible and non deductible expenses. The user also must
      Set the TXF category of each tax related account.  The "Tax
      Information" dialog on the "Accounts" menu is used for this.  It
      is best to set this up before actually exporting, otherwise, you
      will just get an empty file.  There is a taxreport.xac file in the
      examples directory, which shows one way this can be set up.

<PARA><EMPHASIS>IMPORTANT:</EMPHASIS> Most TXF codes should only appear
      on a single account!  The exceptions are codes for which the
      "Payer Name Source" is not grayed, each of which can appear many
      times. Of course, each duplicate should have a unique payer
      name. These are typically interest accounts or stocks or mutual
      funds that pay dividends.

      <LISTITEM><PARA>Accounts: for which to set a TXF category.
        If no account is selected nothing is changed.  If multiple
        accounts are selected, all of the Income accounts will be set to
        the selected item. </PARA></LISTITEM>

      <LISTITEM><PARA>TXF categories: Select the desired one. A <LINK

        appears just below.</PARA></LISTITEM>

      <LISTITEM><PARA>Payer Name Source: A text description that is
        exported along with the value of the account.  This is usually
        the name of a bank, stock, or mutual fund that pays dividends or
        interest.  Occasionally, it is a description of a
        deduction.</PARA>

        <PARA>In the Accounts list box above, "Money Market Fund One" is
        an example of where the name of the current account is exported.
        This is typically used when the fund pays only one type of
        income, such as interest.  For "Mutual Fund Four" and "Mutual
        Fund Five", the categories "Long Term Cap Gain" and "Dividend
        Income" both will export the name of the parent account.  This
        is typically used when the fund pays several different types of
        distributions.  As shown in this example, these funds have three
        types of distributions, but the "Income" and "Short Term Cap
        Gain" categories are totaled and exported together as "Dividend
        Income", as they are taxed the same.</PARA></LISTITEM>
