<PARA>This is the "Register" or the "Ledger" window. Transactions
    are entered here.

    </PARA>
<PARA>To enter a new transaction, just type into the last blank
    transaction. As well as just typing them in, you can use
    the <LINK LINKEND="DATE">Date Accelerator keys</LINK> to
    quickly enter dates. Use the mouse or the <LINK LINKEND="XACC-REGWIN-KBD">Register Keyboard Shortcuts</LINK>to move
    between fields, and press the <KEYCAP>Enter</KEYCAP> key or click
    <GUIBUTTON>record</GUIBUTTON> on the toolbar to record

<PARA>You can edit existing transactions in a similar manner.
    GnuCash will prompt you to confirm any changes you make.

    </PARA>
<PARA>After you have entered a few transactions, GnuCash will try
    to guess some or all of the remaining details of a transaction
    when you type into the <GUILABEL>Description</GUILABEL> field. If GnuCash has
    guessed wrong, simply type over or delete the incorrect
    information and replace it with the correct information.

<TITLE> Viewing Transactions</TITLE>
<PARA>The register can show transactions in a variety of different
    ways, controlled by entries on the <GUIMENU>Register</GUIMENU> menu.

    </PARA>
<PARA>The register can display transactions in several different
    styles:

    </PARA>
    <VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><GUIMENUITEM>single-line</GUIMENUITEM> mode</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Transactions are displayed on a single line.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><GUIMENUITEM>double-line</GUIMENUITEM> mode</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Transactions are displayed over
      two lines, with more information about each transaction
      shown.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><GUIMENUITEM>multi-line</GUIMENUITEM> mode</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Transactions are displayed over
      multiple lines, allowing the display of multiple entries.
      This allows you to enter multi-split transactions (for
      instance, when you pay multiple bills with one check).

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>

</VARLISTENTRY>
</VARIABLELIST>

<PARA>To change the display style, to go the <GUIMENU>Register</GUIMENU>
    menu and select a style from the <GUISUBMENU>Style</GUISUBMENU> submenu.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Existing transactions are normally displayed in date order,
    but this can also be changed with the <GUIMENU>Register</GUIMENU>
    menu's <GUISUBMENU>Sort Order</GUISUBMENU> submenu. You can also
    select a date rate from which transactions will be displayed

<SECT1 ID="XACC-RECONCILIATION">
<TITLE> Reconciliation</TITLE>
<PARA>Transactions are typically checked against bank statements -
    a process known as "reconciliation". GnuCash keeps track of the
    reconciliation status of each transaction.

    </PARA>
<PARA>The reconciliation status of a transaction is shown by the
    reconciliation (<GUILABEL>R</GUILABEL>) field. '<LITERAL>y</LITERAL>'
    indicates that a transaction has been reconciled,
    '<LITERAL>n</LITERAL>' indicates that it has not, and
    '<LITERAL>c</LITERAL>' indicates that it has been cleared, but not
    reconciled.  When a transaction has cleared, you can change its status
    to '<LITERAL>c</LITERAL>' by clicking on its <GUILABEL>R</GUILABEL>
    field.

    </PARA>
<PARA>At the bottom of the account window, there are two running
    totals: '<GUILABEL>Balance</GUILABEL>', and
    '<GUILABEL>Cleared</GUILABEL>'. '<GUILABEL>Cleared</GUILABEL>' should
    correspond to how much money the bank thinks you have in your
    account, while '<GUILABEL>Balance</GUILABEL>' includes outstanding
    transactions.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Reconciliation can be done in the <LINK LINKEND="XACC-RECNWIN">Reconcile Window</LINK>

<PARA>The portfolio ledger can seem a bit daunting at first
    sight.

    </PARA>
<PARA>If you have trouble understanding it, then you may wish to
    create an account for each stock you wish to track.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Some important points to remember about the portfolio
    window:

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>        It shows <EMPHASIS>all</EMPHASIS> stocks in your portfolio, not just
        one. 

        </PARA>
<PARA>The share amounts shown are for each particular
        stock.
      

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>        Note that it uses a two line display. 

        </PARA>
<PARA>Debited accounts and debited amounts are on the upper
        line, and credited amounts and accounts are on the lower
        line.
      

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the total balance will not change, since the value
      of the stock equals the amount of money exchanged.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the value of the transaction will appear twice, once
      in red, and once in black. If shares are purchased, the
      amount of money debited from the brokerage account will be in
      red, and the value of the shares in black. If shares are
      sold, then value of the shares is in red, and the money
      credited to the brokerage account in black.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If you are having trouble indicating a share
      purchase/sale in the portfolio ledger, then make sure that
      <GUILABEL>Transfer From</GUILABEL> and <GUILABEL>Transfer To</GUILABEL> accounts are in
      the right order. A transfer from a stock account is always
      interpreted as a sale, even if you entered the data as a
      purchase. The vice-versa is also true.

<PARA>Eventually, an alternative simpler portfolio ledger
      window may be provided.
