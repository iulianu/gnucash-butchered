	GnuCash Data Files
      </title>
      <para>In normal operation, GnuCash saves your data in normal data files,
	which can be located in any directory you have permissions for.  They
	are self-contained and can be moved, copied, and backed-up to tape, 
	floppies, or any other medium you choose.
        They can be saved using any name, and any file extension you choose, but, traditionally
      the developers and users have used the extension ".xac".
      </para>

      <para>
	The GnuCash file format has changed between the 1.4 and 1.6 releases.  The
	new version uses XML (making it much easier to write independent tools to 
	manipulate GnuCash files) and supports storing much more meta-information, amongst
	many other benefits.  GnuCash 1.6 can read files from older versions, but
	older versions <emphasis>cannot</emphasis>read GnuCash 1.6 files.  We suggest
	that GnuCash users who wish to share data upgrade to 1.6.
      </para>

      <para>Gnucash <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> directly open data files from any other 
      accounting package.  It can, however, import QIF files that Quicken, Microsoft
      Money, and several other packages use an export format with the 
      <link linkend="xacc-quicken">QIF importer</link>.  GnuCash does not have the 
	ability to export QIFs at present, though such functionality would be highly
	desirable - if anybody with some coding skills wants to work on it, please
	contact the developers.
