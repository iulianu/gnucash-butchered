<PARA>
If you hold assets for business purposes, thier decline in value over
time can be treated as a deduction for tax purposes, called
Depreciation.  On the other hand, if you own assets such as real estate,
collectibles (like paintings), and investments (like shares in
companies), you may see them appreciate in value over time.  In this
case, you must recognize -- for tax purposes -- what are called 
<EMPHASIS>Captial Gains</EMPHASIS>
</PARA>

<PARA>This section discusses the handling of
    depreciation and appreciation of assets in GnuCash.
    It also provides a brief introduction to the related tax
    issues.

<PARA><EMPHASIS>Warning:</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS>Be aware that different countries can
    have <EMPHASIS>substantially</EMPHASIS> different tax policies for handling
    these things; all that this document can really provide is some
    of the underlying ideas to help you apply your "favorite"
    tax/depreciation policies.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA>Appreciation and depreciation of assets are
    treated somewhat differently:

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA><LINK LINKEND="XACC-DEPRECIATION">Depreciation</LINK> 
        is <EMPHASIS>usually</EMPHASIS>
        recognized (the technical term is <EMPHASIS>accrued</EMPHASIS>) as an
        ongoing expense, gradually reducing the value
        of an asset toward zero. 
        Depreciation is usually only calculated on assets 
        used for professional or business purposes, because
        governments don't generally allow you to claim depreciation
        deductions on personal assets, and it's pointless to bother
        with the procedure if it's not deductible.

<TITLE> Capital Gains - Asset Appreciation</TITLE>
<PARA>    <ANCHOR ID="APPR"> 
    </PARA>
<PARA>Appreciation of assets is generally a tricky
    matter because, for some sorts of
    assets, it is difficult to correctly estimate an increase in
    value <EMPHASIS>until you actually sell the asset.</EMPHASIS>

    If you invest in securities
    traded daily on open markets such as stock
    exchanges, prices are often quite exact, and selling the asset at
    market prices may be as simple as calling a broker and issuing
    a <EMPHASIS>Market Order.</EMPHASIS>
    On the other hand, homes in your neighborhood are sold
    somewhat less often.  Such sales tend to involve expending
    considerable effort, and involve negotiations, which means that
    estimates are likely to be less precise. Similarly, selling a
    used automobile involves a negotiation process that makes
    pricing a bit less predictable.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Values of collectible objects such as
    jewelry, works of art, baseball cards, and "Beanie Babies" 
    are harder to estimate.
    The
    markets for such objects are somewhat less open than the
    securities markets.
    Worse still are one-of-a-kind assets. Factories often
    contain presses and dies customized to build a very specific
    product that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars;
    this equipment may be <EMPHASIS>worthless</EMPHASIS> outside of that very
    specific context. In such cases, several conflicting
    values might be attached to the asset, <EMPHASIS>none</EMPHASIS> of them
    unambiguously correct.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Let's suppose you buy an asset expected to increase in
    value, say a Degas painting, and want to track this. (The
    insurance company will care about this, even if nobody else
    does.)
    Properly tracking the continually increasing value of the
    Degas will require at least three, quite possibly the following
    four accounts (plus a bank or cash account where the money for
    the purchase comes from):

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>An <EMPHASIS>Asset Cost</EMPHASIS> asset account to track the
      original cost of the painting.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<PARA>An <EMPHASIS>Accrued Unrealized Gains on Asset</EMPHASIS> asset
      account to keep track of increases in value.
      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>An <EMPHASIS>Accrued Gain On Asset Income</EMPHASIS> income account
      in which to record the income side of the annual gains in

    The people that got "rich" in 1999 from IPOs of
    Linux-related companies like Red Hat Software and VA Linux
    Systems could verify this. They hold options or stock that are
    <EMPHASIS>theoretically</EMPHASIS> valued at millions of dollars USD.
    They aren't actually millionaires; the
    principal participants have to hold their stock for at least
    six months before selling <EMPHASIS>any</EMPHASIS> of it. The fact that
    they <EMPHASIS>can't</EMPHASIS> sell it means that while it may in theory

<PARA>Taxation policies vary considerably between countries, so it

    capital gains to not be subject to taxation until the date that
    the asset is actually sold, and sometimes not even then.

    North American home owners <EMPHASIS>usually</EMPHASIS> find that when
    they sell personal residences, capital gains that occur are
    exempt from taxation. It appears that other countries treat
    sale of homes differently, taxing people on such gains. German

    The result of this approach is that asset value decreases

<TITLE>A Word of Caution</TITLE>
<PARA>Since depreciation and tax issues are closely related, you
    may not always be free in choosing your preferred method.
    Fixing wrong calculations will cost a whole lot more time and
    trouble than getting the calculations right the first time, so
    if you plan to depreciate assets, it is wise to make sure of
    the schemes you will be permitted <EMPHASIS>or required</EMPHASIS> to
    use.
