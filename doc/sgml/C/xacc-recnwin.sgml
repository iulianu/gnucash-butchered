<TITLE>Reconciliation Window</TITLE>
</ARTHEADER>

<PARA>The Reconciliation window is used to reconcile a GnuCash account with
    a statement that a bank or other institution has sent you.

    </PARA>
<PARA>For example, when you write a check for something, you should enter
    the transaction into GnuCash.  The reconciliation
    (<GUILABEL>R</GUILABEL>) field of the transaction will initially
    contain <LITERAL>n</LITERAL> (not reconciled).  Later, if you think
    that the check has been cashed, you might click on the transaction's
    <GUILABEL>R</GUILABEL> field to change it to <LITERAL>c</LITERAL>
    (cleared, but not reconciled).

    </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the month, you receive your bank statement,
    perhaps including canceled checks. At that point,
    you should "reconcile" the account, that is, match your personal
    records with the documentation provided by the bank.

    </PARA>

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Open the reconcile window by selecting
    <GUIMENUITEM>Reconcile...</GUIMENUITEM> from the
    <GUIMENU>Accounts</GUIMENU> menu of the account's
    <LINK LINKEND="xacc-regwin">Register window</LINK>.  GnuCash will prompt
    you for some information from the statement:

</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Enter the date of the end of the period that the statement covers,
     and the final balance from the statement, and press
     <GUIBUTTON>OK</GUIBUTTON>.  The Reconcile window will pop up.  It
     looks like this:

     </MEDIAOBJECT>

     <PARA>The <GUILABEL>Funds In</GUILABEL> and <GUILABEL>Funds Out</GUILABEL>
     groups lists all the unreconciled transactions.  The
     '<GUILABEL>?</GUILABEL>' columns show whether the transactions have 
     been cleared or reconciled.

     </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Now, examine each item on the bank statement, and look for the
     matching item in the Reconcile window.   

     </PARA>
<PARA>If you cannot find one, then perhaps you forgot to enter a
     transaction, or did not know that the transaction had happened.  You
     can use the <GUIBUTTON>New</GUIBUTTON> button on the tool bar, or the
     <GUIMENUITEM>New</GUIMENUITEM> menu item in the
     <GUIMENU>Transaction</GUIMENU> menu, to open a register window and
     enter the missing transaction.  The new item will appear in the
     Reconcile window when you press <GUIBUTTON>enter</GUIBUTTON> after
     entering the transaction.

     </PARA>
<PARA>When you find the item in the Reconcile window, compare the amount in
     the item to the amount on the statement.  If they disagree, you may
     have made an error when you entered the transaction in GnuCash.  You
     can use the <GUIBUTTON>Edit</GUIBUTTON> button on the tool bar, or the
     <GUIMENUITEM>Edit</GUIMENUITEM> menu item in the
     <GUIMENU>Transaction</GUIMENU> menu, to open a register window and
     correct the transaction.

     </PARA>
<PARA>If the amounts agree, click on the item in the Reconcile window. The
     '<GUILABEL>?</GUILABEL>' column will change to '<LITERAL>y</LITERAL>'
     (reconciled) from '<LITERAL>n</LITERAL>' or '<LITERAL>c</LITERAL>'.

     </PARA>
<PARA>You then repeat this for each item that appears on the
        bank statement, verifying that the amounts match with the
        amounts in GnuCash, and marking off transactions in GnuCash
        as they are reconciled.
      

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>At the bottom of the window is a difference field, which
      should be $0.00 when you are done reconciling. If it isn't,
      then you have either missed transactions, or some amounts may
      be incorrect in GnuCash. (Or, probably rather less likely,
      the bank may have made an error.)
      
      

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>When you have completed marking off all the items on the
      bank statement, and when the difference is $0.00, you should press the
      <GUIBUTTON>Finish</GUIBUTTON> button on the tool bar or select
      <GUIMENUITEM>Finish</GUIMENUITEM> from the
      <GUIMENU>Reconcile</GUIMENU> menu.  The Reconcile window will close.
      In the <LINK LINKEND="xacc-regwin">Register window</LINK>, the
      <GUILABEL>R</GUILABEL> field of the reconciled transactions will
      change to '<LITERAL>y</LITERAL>'.
