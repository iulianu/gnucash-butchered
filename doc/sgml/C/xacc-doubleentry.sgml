<PARA>
    Double-entry accounting helps you avoid mistakes.  This is why
    professional accountants use it.  If you are new to accounting, 
    it will help you organize your records and keep you from creating an
    unauditable mess.  If you are an experienced accountant, then you
    probably won't want to imagine what life was like before it.

<TITLE> What is Double Entry Accounting?</TITLE>
<PARA>    </PARA>
<PARA>Double entry bookkeeping is an accounting methodology
    introduced in the 13th century to to make sure that each
    transaction and account is properly balanced.
    It greatly reduces the likelihood of data-entry errors.

    </PARA>
<PARA>A double-entry transaction is a transaction that contains
    entries for two (or more) accounts that balance against one
    another. One account is <EMPHASIS>debited</EMPHASIS> by an amount 
    equal to what the other is <EMPHASIS>credited.</EMPHASIS> By ensuring that
    each transaction balances, a balanced set of accounts is
    guaranteed. This doesn't totally prevent errors, but it does
    eliminate the class of <EMPHASIS>"I forgot to enter
    that part of the transaction"</EMPHASIS> errors.
    In the course  of maintaining large, complex sets of accounts with many
    transactions, it is very easy to make errors that may go undetected for
    a long time, and be appallingly difficult to track down, even when
    double-entry bookkeeping is used.

<TITLE> The Rule of Double-Entry Accounting</TITLE>
<PARA>The intuitive way of understanding double-entry 
    is as a transfer from one bank account to another,
    where the amount taken out of one bank account must equal that
    deposited in the other. This is effectively the "rule" of double entry
    accounting; if you add something in to one account, you 
    have to subtract it from somewhere else.
    When this is done regularly and consistently, this results in the
    identity of accounting:
    <ANCHOR ID="IDENTITY">
    <ENVAR>Total of Debits = Total of Credits.</ENVAR>


    </PARA>
<PARA>There is another important aspect to double-entry that
    should also be understood: to get the complete picture,
    you must also track income and expense.  When you deposit
    your paycheck into your bank account, that money didn't 
    come 'from thin air'.   Thus, when you record that bank deposit,
    you shouldn't fool your accounting system about that thin air.
    You should record your income in an income account:  
    the money that goes into your bank comes from your income 
    account.  Once again, adding in one place subtracts from another.
    By keeping track of your income and expenses, you can ultimately
    keep track of your equity:  Simply put, after years of earning and
    spending, what you have left is what you got in, minus the 
    amount you spent.  
    </PARA>

(At this point, the documentation should discuss in greater
detail what happens when you spend money to buy a sofa
(except for money lost to taxes and shipping fees, 
your net worth doesn't change much), and what happens as that sofa
wears out (depreciation).  Again, these are transfers of money between
accounts.  What's left over is the equity.  Be sure to point out that
using doubble-entry against income+expense accounts is the correct way
to track the change over time.)

<PARA><EMPHASIS>Insider knowledge:</EMPHASIS> 
    GnuCash treats "Debits" as positive values, and "Credits" as
    negative values, and so the identity of accounting
    simplifies to 
    <LITERAL>value<SUBSCRIPT>1</SUBSCRIPT> + 
    value<SUBSCRIPT>2</SUBSCRIPT> + 
    value<SUBSCRIPT>3</SUBSCRIPT> + ...
    = 0</LITERAL>
    Calling this 
   <EMPHASIS>double</EMPHASIS>-entry bookkeeping is a bit misleading; 
    it would be
    somewhat more accurate to call it <EMPHASIS>multiple-</EMPHASIS>entry
    bookkeeping. Unfortunately, there's 700 years of history of use
    of the term, which sufficiently discourages changing it. (And you
    thought parts of Unix were crufty and old!)

    </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS>Insider knowledge:</EMPHASIS> 
    Bank statements are frequently written up from the 
    <EMPHASIS>bank's</EMPHASIS> perspective, which is 
    exactly <EMPHASIS>opposite</EMPHASIS> to
    yours. For example, when you make a deposit at the bank,
    you are giving them money which they promise to pay you back
    someday.  To the bank, your money is a debt: it is money that they
    owe you.  Thus, when you receive a statement from them, 
    you may find the columns to be oddly mislabelled:  your
    deposits are marked as 'debits', and withdrawls as 'credits'.
    This practice is particularly common at older and more staid 
    banks.

<PARA>To <EMPHASIS>change</EMPHASIS> a double-entry transaction:

    </PARA>
<PARA>Simply edit the transaction in any window in which it
    appears.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Any changes made will be automatically reflected in both
    accounts and all windows displaying the transaction.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, when a double-entry transaction is deleted, the
    "splits" will be deleted from both accounts, and balances will
    automatically be recalculated for <EMPHASIS>both</EMPHASIS> accounts.

    </PARA>
<PARA>To change the transfer account, simply select a new account
    from the pull-down menu. When you record the transaction, it
    will automatically be selected from the old account, and
    inserted into the new account.

<PARA>GnuCash may be configured to be strict about double entry,

    </PARA>
<PARA>In "loose" mode, you can create <EMPHASIS>unbalanced
    transactions,</EMPHASIS> that is, transactions where the "splits"
    don't balance to zero. That discards the validation that comes
    from using the more strict double entry scheme, which is
    probably not a really wise move. In effect:

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If you aren't sure of what you're doing, you likely do
      not want to discard the validation of <EMPHASIS>double entry,</EMPHASIS> as

    </PARA>
<PARA>But if you decide to "outsmart the system," and have a

    transactions, you <EMPHASIS>Scrub</EMPHASIS> the account clean by choosing
    <GUIMENU>Scrub</GUIMENU> from the window menu.

    </PARA>
<PARA>The process will examine each transaction; if the
    transaction doesn't balance, a split entry will be created and
    placed into an account named <EMPHASIS>Unbalanced.</EMPHASIS> You may then
    review these splits and move them to their proper accounts.

    </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Warning: Functionality Changing...</EMPHASIS>

    </PARA>
