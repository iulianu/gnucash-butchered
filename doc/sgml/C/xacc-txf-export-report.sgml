<PARA>This report allows you to export all tax related Income and Expenses
      to a TXF (Tax eXchange Format) file that can be imported into tax
      filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax.

    </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS>NOTE:</EMPHASIS> For this to work, the user has to
      segregate taxable and not taxable income to different accounts, as
      well as deductible and non deductible expenses. The user also must
      Set the TXF category of each tax related account.  The "Txf Export
      Init" tab on the parameter dialog allows this.  It is best to set
      this up from the Tax Report before actually running this report.
      Otherwise, you will just get an empty file.  There is a
      taxreport.xac file in the examples directory, which shows one way
      this can be set up.

<PARA><EMPHASIS>IMPORTANT:</EMPHASIS> Most TXF codes should only appear
      on a single account!  The exceptions are codes preceded with
      "&lt;" or "^", which can appear many times.  Of course, each
      duplicate should have a unique payer name.

<PARA>All of the parameters for the Tax Report still apply for the
      actual export.  Only the "Txf Export Init" parameters are described
      here.

      <LISTITEM><PARA>The account(s) for which to set a TXF category.
        If no account is selected nothing is changed.  If multiple
        accounts are selected, all of the Income accounts will be set to
        the selected item in the INCOME list box, and all of the Expense
        accounts will be set to the selected item in the EXPENSE list
        box. </PARA></LISTITEM>

        ONE!)</PARA></LISTITEM> 

      <LISTITEM><PARA>TXF categories preceded with a "&lt;" or "^"
        export a payer name along with the value of the account.  This
        is usually the name of a bank, stock, or mutual fund that pays
        dividends or interest.  Occasionally, it is a description of a
        deduction.</PARA>

        <PARA>On the report above, "Money Market Fund One" is an example
        of where the name of the current account is exported.  This is
        typically used when the fund pays only one type if income, such
        as interest.  For "Mutual Fund Four" and "Mutual Fund Five", the
        categories "Long Term Cap Gain" and "Dividend Income" both will
        export the name of the parent account.  This is typically used
        when the fund pays several different types of distributions.  As
        shown in this example, these funds have three types of
        distributions, but the "Income" and "Short Term Cap Gain"
        categories are totaled and exported together as "Dividend
        Income", as they are taxed the same.</PARA>
