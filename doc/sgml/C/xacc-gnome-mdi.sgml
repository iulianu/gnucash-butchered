<para>GnuCash can display multiple views of your finances at once, in 
multiple windows, a tabbed "notebook" style, or in one plain window.
This facility is provided through the GNOME MDI (multiple document
interface).  When you open a new 
<link linkend="xacc-mainwin">account tree</link>
or <link linkend="xacc-reports">report</link> using the file menu, the
new view can be displayed in several ways.

<para>Notebook view puts all new views in the main window, but places
them on named tabs - just like a real notebook, in fact.  You can bring
a notebook tab to the front by clicking on it.</para>

<para>If this mode is selected, a new top-level window will be created
for the new view.  You can move and resize this window any way you
want, independently of the original gnucash main window.  If you have
a window manager that supports multiple desktops, you can happily
move it onto a to a different one.

<para>The single-window view works like the notebook view, except
that instead of using tabs to select which report/account 
tree you wish to view, you can select them from the Window menu.

<title>Selecting MDI Modes</title>
<para>MDI mode can be set in two different ways.  Firstly
you can set it within GnuCash through the "Application MDI Mode"
option in the <link linkend="xacc-preferences">
Preferences Dialog</link></para>
<para>However, if you prefer a particular MDI mode across all your
GNOME applications, you can set the preference for all of them in 
the MDI section of the GNOME Configuration program (see the GNOME
on-line help for more details).  To get GnuCash to recognize the
global setting, set the "Application MDI Mode" option in the preferences
dialog to "Use GNOME Default".</para>
