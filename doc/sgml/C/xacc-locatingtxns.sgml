<PARA>The Find Transactions dialog allows you to search for
transactions which match criteria that you specify, including:
<ITEMIZEDLIST>

<LISTITEM>
<PARA> Value of the transaction,</PARA>

<PARA> You may bring up the <EMPHASIS> Find Transactions </EMPHASIS>
dialog by clicking on the "Find" button in the main GnuCash window or
any register display window.

</PARA>
<PARA> The results of your search will be shown in a register display
similar to the ones used to display your accounts, with the window
title "Search Results".

    </PARA>
<PARA>Clicking the "Find" button again within a Search Results
register window allows you to add additional terms to the query whose
results are displayed in that window.  </PARA>
<PARA> By combining multiple searches,
you may construct rather sophisticated queries to display exactly the
subset of your transactions that you want to see.</PARA>

<TITLE>How to use the Find Transactions dialog</TITLE>
<PARA>    </PARA>
<PARA>The Find Transactions dialog has two main parts.  

<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA> The upper
part of the dialog is a Notebook with tabs that allow you to specify
the conditions of your search.  </PARA>
<PARA> See <LINK LINKEND="SETUP">Setting up a
search</LINK> for details on each search type. 

</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>The lower part of the
dialog is a selector which allows you to specify how the results of
the search are to be combined with any previous search.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>

    </PARA>
<PARA>If you get the Find Transactions dialog by clicking the Find
button in the main GnuCash window or any normal account display
register, the only option available will be "New Search".  If you
select Find from within a Search Results register the other options
will be available; see <LINK LINKEND="MODIFY">Modifying your search</LINK> for
details.

    </PARA>
<PARA>Most simple queries can be directly handled by a single
invocation of the Find Transactions dialog.  The dialog has nine tabs,
each of which represents a particular field of the transaction (or
split) that you can search on.  If you specify conditions on multiple
fields (for example, selecting one or more accounts in the Accounts
tab and also entering a date range in the Date tab), a transaction
must match all the conditions you specify in order to be displayed.

    </PARA>
<PARA>If simple searches are not specific enough, you can combine
them by clicking the Find button in a search results window and
selecting any "Type of Search" except "New search".

<TITLE>Account searches</TITLE>
<PARA>In the Account tab, select any accounts of interest and then
choose whether transactions affecting Any, All, or None of these
accounts is to be displayed.
      
    </PARA>
<PARA>If you select "All" accounts from the picker at the top of the
tab, the only transactions that will be show are those which affect
all the selected accounts.  </PARA>
<PARA> For example, if you select <EMPHASIS>My
Checking Account</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS> My VISA Account</EMPHASIS> and then choose <EMPHASIS>All</EMPHASIS>, only transfers from Checking to Visa will be shown.

    </PARA>
<PARA>If you select "Any" from the picker, transactions affecting any
selected amount will be shown.  For example, if you select "My
Checking Account" and "My VISA Account" and then choose "Any", your
entire checking account and your entire Visa account will be shown
together in the Search Results window.

<SECT3 ID="DATE">
<TITLE>Date searches</TITLE>
<PARA>In the Date tab, you can specify a date range for the
transactions you wish to find.  The year, month, and day fields are in
the order you specify in <GUIMENU> Preferences:International:Date Format</GUIMENU>.

    </PARA>
<PARA>If you want to locate any transaction before a certain date,
specify your date in the second date entry and put a distant date in
the past in the first date entry.  The default date is January 1,
1900, which should be distant enough for most peoples' purposes.  </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, if you want to find any transaction after a certain date,
put the date in the first date entry and put a date after your last
transaction in the second entry.

<TITLE>Amount searches</TITLE>

<PARA> If you select the "Case sensitive"
toggle button, the search is a case-sensitive substring match.  </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
