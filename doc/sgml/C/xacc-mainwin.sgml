<PARA>The <GUIMENU>Open Subaccounts</GUIMENU> menu item is interesting only
    if you choose an account with sub-accounts (detail accounts).
    Accounts with sub-accounts will always have a box on their
    left. By choosing the <GUIMENU>Open Subaccounts</GUIMENU> menu item, a
    general ledger window is opened, which displays all
    transactions for the lead and the detail accounts. Note that
    the general ledger window is more complicated and harder to use
    than the individual account registers. The general ledger
    window allows a more comprehensive overview of accounts in a
    smaller space. Because of its increased complexity, it use is
    recommended only for accounting experts.
