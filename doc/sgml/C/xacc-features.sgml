      Basic features

    <para>
      GnuCash is powerful, versatile, and easy to use.  If you want
      to get an idea of everything GnuCash offers, read on!
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem> 
	<para><emphasis>Multiple Accounts.</emphasis> Create a GnuCash
	 account for each of your bank accounts.  Each account
	  maintains both a running balance and a reconciled balance, 
	  so you can keep track of the checks that have cleared your 
	  account.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem> 
	<para> <emphasis>Simple User Interface.</emphasis> </para>
	<para>If you can use the register in the back of your checkbook, you
	  can use <application>GnuCash.</application> Type directly into the
	  register, tab between fields, and use quick-fill to automatically
	  complete transactions.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem> <para> <emphasis><link linkend="xacc-recnwin">Automated Tools
	      for Reconciling Accounts.</link></emphasis> </para>
	
	<para>At the end of the month, open up the <emphasis>reconcile</emphasis>
	  window, enter the ending balance from your bank statement, and check
	  off the transactions that appear in the bank statement. This agrees
	  what you have recorded in GnuCash with what your bank has reported,
	  and makes it easier to track down any discrepancies. </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem> <para> <emphasis>QuickFill.</emphasis> </para>
	
	<para>If you begin typing in the description field, and the text matches
	  a previous transaction, hitting <keycap>TAB</keycap> will copy in that
	  previous transaction. This is a handy time saver if you regularly create
	  similar transactions.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem> <para> <emphasis>Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolios.</emphasis> </para>
	
	<para>Track stocks individually (one per account) or in
	  portfolio of accounts (a group of accounts that can be
	  displayed together).
	  There are tools to 
	  <link linkend="xacc-price-editor">automatically collect stock quotes.</link>
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>Support for <emphasis><link linkend="xacc-currencyhandling">multiple
	      currencies</link></emphasis> and <emphasis>currency trading accounts.
	  </emphasis>
	  (partial, still limited). 
	  Bank accounts may be established in different
	  currencies, and trades at varying exchange rates may be
	  made, in much the same way stocks trade at varying
	  prices.
	  
	  
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis><link linkend="XACC-QIF-IMPORT">Quicken File Import</link>.</emphasis> 
	</para>
	<para>Imports Quicken-style QIF files.  The import wizard automatically
	  merges duplicate transactions.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Gnome MDI Interface</emphasis></para>
	<para>Have multiple views of your financial data, arranged how you want
	  them, in one or more windows that stay around through GnuCash sessions.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis><link
	linkend="xacc-reports">Reports</link>.</emphasis> Display,
	export as HTML, or print a variety of reports, including
	Balance Sheet, Account Summary, Profit and Loss, Stock
	Portfolios, and Transaction Reports.  Reports are saved from

	relative dates.  GnuCash also supports a variety of
	customizable, printable, bar and pie charts.

    <title>Advanced Features</title>
    <para>GnuCash offers some features not found in simpler accounting
      programs.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para> <emphasis><link linkend="xacc-chartofaccts">Chart of Accounts</link></emphasis> 

 </para>
<para>A master account can have a hierarchy of more detailed
        accounts arranged underneath it. This allows related
        account types (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - Cash, Bank, Stock) to be
        grouped under one master account ( <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> -
        Assets).

 </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis><link linkend="xacc-doubleentry">Double
      Entry</link></emphasis> 

 </para>
<para>Every transaction must debit one account and credit others
      by an equal amount. This ensures that the 'books balance':
      that the difference between income and outflow exactly equals
      the sum of all assets, be they bank, cash, stock or other.

 </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis><link linkend="xacc-incomeexpense">Income/Expense Account
      Types (Categories)</link></emphasis> 
 </para>
<para>These serve not only to categorize your cash flow, but when used
properly with the double-entry feature and equity accounts, these can
provide an accurate Profit & Loss statement.
 </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><emphasis>General Ledger</emphasis> </para>

<para>Multiple accounts may be displayed in one register
        window at the same time. This can make it easier to track
        down data errors. It also provides a convenient way of
        viewing a portfolio of many stocks, by showing all
        transactions in that portfolio.
