.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnucash [--debug] [
.I accounts.gnc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gnucash
is a personal accounting package that allows you to record
and track income, expenses, assets, and investments.  It supports
reconciliation, has substantial reporting capabilities, and is
extensible using guile.  It can import QIF data from Quicken(TM) and
many other commercial accounting packages. It uses GTK+ and GNOME to
provide an attractive user interface, and has extensive online help.

information see the README file.
