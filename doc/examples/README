Guide to *.xac Files:
---------------------
Many of the *.xac files are from older versions of X-Accountant,
and will cause a warning message to be displayed.  They are
here to help ensure backwards-compatibility with older
versions of GnuCash.  They should otherwise work just fine.

    and a variety of taxes.

    and a margin account.
