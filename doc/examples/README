Guide to *.qfx Files:
---------------------
QFX is the extension given to files that contain OFX XML data.
Some banks allow users to download QFX files containing statement
data, instead of allowing the PFM to talk to the bank directly.
(Presumably, these banks block direct PFM OFX exchanges for security
reasons).  The goal here is to be sure that we can import QFX files
properly.

Note that these files are all single-entry statements, rather than
double-entry ledgers.  Thus, we only know where the money is coming
from, and have no idea of where its going to: a human will have to
pick through these during import. #@$%^&*(

Guide to *.gnucash Files:
---------------------
Many of the *.gnucash files are from older versions of X-Accountant,
and will cause a warning message to be displayed.  They are
here to help ensure backwards-compatibility with older
versions of GnuCash.  They should otherwise work just fine.
