/** \page osxbuild Building GnuCash on OSX

\section dependency Automake dependency

automake1.4 is NOT compatible with gnucash on OSX. If fink replaces
a later automake during an update of other packages, you will need
to replace with a later version. Fink will then remove automake1.4 
in favour of the later version. GnuCash has been tested on OSX with
automake1.9

\section building Build advice

'make uninstall' may not be sufficient - when rebuilding in the same
source tree, remove the installation directory with 'rm -rf'. 

\section osxprepare Preparation

There are notable problems building gnucash with the default
auto tools installed in OSX and even installing the GNU versions
via fink may not be sufficient - OSX may still call the BSD version
in preference to the newly installed GNU version.

To avoid these problems, you are advised to change your PATH variable
in ~/.bashrc to put the Fink binaries ahead of the main OSX binaries
in your path or export a new PATH in the script that calls autogen.sh.
Instead of:
\verbatim
PATH=/usr/bin/:/sbin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/opt/local/bin:/sw/bin
/endverbatim
use:
/verbatim
PATH=/sw/bin:/usr/bin/:/sbin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/opt/local/bin
/endverbatim

Then, when calling ./autogen.sh and ./configure, it is necessary
to direct OSX to the correct Guile installation environment using:

\verbatim
#!/bin/bash
guile16-build env LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib CPATH=/sw/include \
./autogen.sh
guile16-build env LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib CPATH=/sw/include \
./configure <your configure options>
guile16-build env LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib CPATH=/sw/include \
make
\endverbatim

If (when) you do a 'make distclean', this whole process will have to
be done again.

If you have to change automake or autoconf versions, make sure you
remove the autom4te.cache/ directory before running autogen.sh again.

\section osxtools OSX tools

GnuCash recommends <b>only>/b> the most recent versions of each of the 
GNU auto tools available via Fink. As of November 2005, these were:

\verbatim
                 10.3         10.4
autoconf2.5     2.59-6       2.59-6
automake1.9     1.9.5-1      1.9.6-1
libtool14       1.5.18-1     1.5.20-1
\endverbatim

Currently, these versions are only available in the unstable (CVS) version
of Fink.
