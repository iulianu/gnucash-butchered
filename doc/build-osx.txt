/** \page osxbuild Building GnuCash on OSX

\section osxprepare Preparation

There are notable problems building gnucash with the default
auto tools installed in OSX and even installing the GNU versions
via fink may not be sufficient - OSX may still call the BSD version
in preference to the newly installed GNU version.

To avoid these problems, you are advised to change your PATH variable
in ~/.bashrc to put the Fink binaries ahead of the main OSX binaries
in the path:
Instead of:
PATH=/usr/bin/:/sbin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/opt/local/bin:/sw/bin
use:
PATH=/sw/bin:/usr/bin/:/sbin/:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/opt/local/bin

Then, when calling ./autogen.sh and ./configure, it may be necessary
to direct OSX to the correct Guile installation environment using:

#!/bin/bash
guile16-build env LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib CPATH=/sw/include \
./autogen.sh
guile16-build env LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib CPATH=/sw/include \
./configure <your configure options>

\section osxtools OSX tools

GnuCash recommends <b>only>/b> the most recent versions of each of the 
GNU auto tools available via Fink. As of November 2005, these were:

\verbatim
                 10.3         10.4
autoconf2.5     2.59-6       2.59-6
automake1.9     1.9.5-1      1.9.6-1
libtool14       1.5.18-1     1.5.20-1
\endverbatim

Currently, these versions are only available in the unstable (CVS) version
of Fink.
