How to install gnucash on SuSE
==============================

Notes:

- This is only one way to get GnuCash running on SuSE. I did test
  that, but there might be errors anyway, and of course you do all at
  your own risk. If you find errors, you might report them to the
  gnucash mailing list (gnucash-devel@gnucash.org)

- This is for SuSE 6.3, 6.4 and 7.0 (Intel). Earlier SuSE distributions
  lack some required packages. Later SuSE distributions didn't exist
  at the time of writing.
  NOTE: You can install new packages to older versions of SuSE from
        CD or ftp.suse.de or ftp.suse.com

- This howto is primarily intended for compiling from source.
  If you install the rpm, you don't need the various dev packages
  and you don't need g-wrap. (However, you won't see this howto
  until you installed the GnuCash rpm succesfully ;-).)

- The current stable version is gnucash-1.4.x,
  the current development version is gnucash-1.5.x,
  the development version needs the latest GNOME libraries
  to build, especially gnprint >= 0.23, gdk_pix >= 0.8
  and gtkhtml-0.8, which are not included with current SuSE 
  distibutions. The easiest way to get the latest GNOME is to do
   "lynx -source http://go-gnome.com | sh"
  as root. At the end of this file is a list which helix gnome
  packages I have installed at the time of this writing.

Let's go:

* Make sure you have a running system, including X. For my tests I
  started with a default installation and removed some packages to
  save diskspace.

* Install the following packages:
  + from series d
       eperl  guile  swig  xmhtml  xmhtmld gettext
       libxml libxmld
    and optionally
       autoconf  automake  libtool
    (You must install libtool if you have autoconf/automake
    installed!) 
  + from series x
       xdevel
  + from series gnm
       gnlibs gnlibsd
    for (check) printing
       gnprint gnprintd
  + from series gra
       imlib imlibdev

* Download slib from
    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/jacal/slib2c7.zip
  and install it by unpacking it to /usr/share/guile (this will
  create a sub-directory slib):
    cd /usr/share/guile
    su root -c "unzip -L /tmp/slib2c7"

* Download g-wrap from
    ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/g-wrap/
  For the 1.4.x version you need g-wrap-0.9.12.tar.gz,
  for the 1.5.x version you need g-wrap-1.1.4.tar.gz or newer
  unpack and untar, then
  ./configure, make, su, make install

* If you want to build the development version, download Guppi from
    ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/guppi/Guppi-0.35.2.tar.gz
  unpack and untar, then
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnome, make, su, make install
  Guppi is not yet part of standard gnome distributions, but I expect it
  to become more common soon.

* Download GnuCash
  stable version:
    http://www.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/sources/stable/gnucash-1.4.x.tar.gz
  development version:
    http://www.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/sources/unstable/1.5.x/gnucash-1.5.x.tar.gz
  and unpack it
    tar xzf gnucash-1.y.x.tar.gz
* Alternatively get GnuCash from cvs
    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.gnucash.org:/home/cvs/cvsroot login (password guest)
    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.gnucash.org:/home/cvs/cvsroot checkout gnucash
    (this will get you the latest development version)

* The lib directory contains packages that are needed to build GnuCash
  but are not widely available yet. Read the file lib/README for details.

* Make symbolic link for every file in /opt/gnome/share/aclocal
  to /usr/share/aclocal (or tell me how to modify the automake setup
  so that it looks in /opt/gnome/share/aclocal for input ;-))

* Configure, build and install gnucash. Installation must probably be
  done as root, the files go to various places in /usr/local.

    cd gnucash-1.y.x
    ./configure
    make
    su root -c "make install"

* You may need to run GnuCash once as root, because guile needs to set up
  some things for slib. Alternatively you can try as root:
    guile -c '(use-modules (ice-9 slib)) (require 'new-catalog)'

* If want to send a patch, you need the makepatch perl module, which can
  be found at:
    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/Johan_Vromans/makepatch-2.00a.tar.gz
  unpack and untar, then
  perl Makefile.PL, make, su, make install
