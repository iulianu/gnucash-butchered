1.2 About this Book (Discussion)

The goal of this manual is to save you time and to get you started in GnuCash as quickly as possible.  Each chapter follows a simple format:

1) "Concepts" discussion
2) "How-To" specific procedures

Beginning users will find the ?Concepts? sections helpful, since they provide a reference and ideas for the best ways to track your finances.   Experienced users  can flip to the "How-To" sections to quickly scan procedures.   These sections provide quick, to-the-point steps for accomplishing specific tasks.    The "Putting It All Together" sections present real-world examples in the form of a tutorial, beginning with creation of a file  in Chapter (?2).  Each successive chapter will build on the previous chapter?s tutorial.

1.3 Top Ten Reasons to Use GnuCash (Discussion)

We've already discussed some of the general advantages of using GnuCash.    Here are some specific features offered by GnuCash that may not exist in other programs.

1)  [Simple user interface]
GnuCash is a Linux financial software package that is as easy to use as a checkbook register.   It's even easier to use than a paper register, because features like (?auto-completion?) and other entry shortcuts do most of the entry work for you.  

2) [Easy import]
GnuCash allows you to import your data from your online bank statement or from another software package using QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) files.  An easy-to-use (?wizard?) walks you through loading your files, reviewing them for changes, and importing them into GnuCash.

3) [Statement reconciliation]
Reconcile those monthly statements quickly by entering the statement ending balance and checking off transactions.  GnuCash helps you catch any discrepancies between your data and the statements you receive.

4) [Investment tracking]
GnuCash offers a host of ways to track your investment portfolio.  Special investment accounts simplify your data entry, and online update tools allow you to update the prices of your holdings as the markets change.  Reports complete the picture, allowing you to analyze your investment decisions.

5) [Multiple currency support]
GnuCash allows you to track multiple currencies.  If you have bank accounts, investments or other financial data in different currencies, you can monitor these in GnuCash.     

6) [Customized reports and graphs]
Reports and graphs can give you valuable information for filing taxes, budgeting, or simply figuring out where all the money goes.  GnuCash offers a variety of easy-to-use reports and graphs to help you analyze your financial position.  It also gives you the freedom to customize your own reports to suit your unique needs.

7) [Double entry]
To provide complete records, GnuCash uses the double entry method of bookkeeping.  Double entry simply means that money doesn't just appear or disappear---an equal amount must come from one location and go to another location.   By entering both locations, you provide information that GnuCash can then use to give you detailed reports of your data.

8) [Sources of help]
A Tip of the Day dialog gives helpful tips to new users about GnuCash features.  Within the program, a searchable Help menu guides you to the information you need or connects you to the GnuCash web page for further assistance.  GnuCash also has  strong developer and user communities, and it is easy to get help from these communities through mailing lists.  

9) [Shortcuts]
GnuCash offers many shortcuts to help you enter your data.   When you type the first few characters of a common entry, it will automatically fill in the rest of the entry.  You can also use copy, paste and duplicate functions to save typing time.  Keyboard shortcuts let you quickly choose a menu option or to enter numerical data.   

10) [Open source]
GnuCash doesn't hide its methods from you.  If you wonder how GnuCash computed a number, you can easily find it out.  In addition, you can set preferences that tell GnuCash how much information to display to you.  There is no "secret code" used in GnuCash---it continues to be an open-source program.

These are only a few of the advantages you'll discover when you start using GnuCash to track your financial information.  Now get ready to enjoy the benefits of GnuCash for yourself!
