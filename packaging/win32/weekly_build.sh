# Note: for this script to work, you need to make sure bash can
#       find svn on your system. If it's not in the default
#       Windows path, you will have to add it yourself, for
#       example like this:
#       - create a file /etc/profile.d/svn.sh
#       - add this line: export PATH=/c/soft/svn/bin:$PATH
#       (Use the real path to your svn installation, obviously)
