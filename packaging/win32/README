These scripts try to download and install a Windows/mingw32 build
environment for GnuCash.

Before you start with the automated build, you have to complete these
steps manually. The directory variables are set in custom.sh.

* Download MSYS (but *only* msys, no mingw and no msysdtk)
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> MSYS -> (bin, *.exe)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Install MSYS (no postinstall)
to $MSYS_DIR

* Download wget
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> mingwPORT -> (bin, wget-*)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Adjust installer.sh and/or custom.sh. Especially in the latter you
  can comment out those build steps that have been completed already
  and/or should not be performed now. If you want verbose output of
  any script step, change the first line in install.sh and add the
  "-x" switch.

Start/Enter any MSYS shell. Let the automated build begin by:

  $INSTALLER_DIR/installer.sh

Good luck!
