These scripts try to download and install a Windows/mingw32 build
environment for GnuCash on Windows. 

For cross-compiling the windows executable on Linux, see the lower
section of this file.

Before you start with the automated build, you have to complete these
steps manually. The directory variables are set in `defaults.sh' and optionally
`custom.sh'.

* Download MSYS (but *only* msys; no mingw and no msysdtk)
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> MSYS -> (bin, *.exe)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Install MSYS (no postinstall)
to $MSYS_DIR

* Download wget
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> mingwPORT -> (bin, wget-*)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Look at defaults.sh and create a file named custom.sh to specify adapted directory
  variables.  If you want verbose output of any script
  step, add "set -x" to that file.

* Either, download Qt from http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows,
  install it and set QTDIR in custom.sh, like "QTDIR=/c/Qt/4.2.3"; or skip building
  the AqBanking Setup Wizard by specifying "AQBANKING_WITH_QT=no".

Start/Enter any MSYS shell window. Let the automated build begin by:

  $INSTALLER_DIR/install.sh

Good luck!

To generate a self-installing setup.exe file that contains
*everything*, run the following command after install.sh has
completed:

  $INSTALLER_DIR/dist.sh

--------------------------

Cross-compiling a Windows/mingw32 executable of GnuCash on a Linux
host system. (Note: This used to work unchangedly in Sept'2006 but
probably not any longer.)

These steps need to be performed:

1. Edit the file create_cross_mingw.sh and set the PREFIX= variable to
   the preferred prefix of the mingw32 gcc/binutils on your
   Linux. (It is strongly recommended to choose a different prefix
   than your normal compiler toolchain in order to distinguish
   your native vs. cross compiler more easily.) Then run the
   script create_cross_mingw.sh - it will
   download, compile, and install a mingw32 toolchain.

2. Edit the file defaults.sh: Make a global search-and-replace of
   '\\' into '/' so that all directories are specified in unix
   conventions. Set the variable cross_compile to "yes". Then
   adjust the directories in defaults.sh according to your
   preferred installation, especially $GLOBAL_DIR.

3. Download a binary windows packages for "guile" e.g. from
   http://www.tu-harburg.de/~et2cs/gnc/ and unpack it into the
   directory $GUILE_DIR as given in defaults.sh. (This is done because
   the build system for guile doesn't support cross-compiling.)

4. Call install.sh, which will read the directory settings from
   defaults.sh. It should download, compile, and install everything
   automatically. Eventually the windows gnucash is installed into
   $GNUCASH_DIR. 

5. The content of $GNUCASH_DIR (as well as all the other binary
   packages) should then be copied to a windows machine. The paths
   in $GNUCASH_DIR/bin/gnucash and/or $GNUCASH_DIR/bin/gnucash.cmd
   need to be adjusted for the installation location on the
   windows machine.

Good luck!
