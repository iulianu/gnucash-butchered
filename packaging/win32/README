These scripts try to download and install a Windows/mingw32 build
environment for GnuCash on Windows. 

For cross-compiling the windows executable on Linux, see the lower
section of this file.

Before you start with the automated build, you have to complete these
steps manually. The directory variables are set in custom.sh.

* Download MSYS (but *only* msys, no mingw and no msysdtk)
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> MSYS -> (bin, *.exe)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Install MSYS (no postinstall)
to $MSYS_DIR

* Download wget
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> mingwPORT -> (bin, wget-*)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Adjust installer.sh and/or custom.sh. Especially in the latter you
  can comment out those build steps that have been completed already
  and/or should not be performed now. If you want verbose output of
  any script step, change the first line in install.sh and add the
  "-x" switch.

Start/Enter any MSYS shell. Let the automated build begin by:

  $INSTALLER_DIR/install.sh

Good luck!

Cross-compiling a Windows/mingw32 executable of GnuCash on a Linux
host system.

These steps need to be performed:

1. Edit the file create_cross_mingw.sh and set the PREFIX= variable to
   the preferred prefix of the mingw32 gcc/binutils on your
   Linux. (It is strongly recommended to choose a different prefix
   than your normal compiler toolchain in order to distinguish
   your native vs. cross compiler more easily.) Then run the
   script create_cross_mingw.sh - it will
   download, compile, and install a mingw32 toolchain.

2. Edit the file custom.sh: Make a globale search-and-replace of
   '\\' into '/' so that all directories are specified in unix
   conventions. Set the variable cross_compile to "yes". Then
   adjust the directories in custom.sh according to your
   preferred installation, especially $GLOBAL_DIR.

3. Download the binary windows packages for "guile" and "g-wrap"
   from http://www.tu-harburg.de/~et2cs/gnc/ and unpack them into
   the directories $GUILE_DIR and $GWRAP_DIR as given in
   custom.sh. (This is done because the build system for guile and
   g-wrap doesn't support cross-compiling.)

4. Call install.sh which will read the directory settings from
   custom.sh. It should download, compile, and install everything
   automatically. Eventually the windows gnucash is installed into
   $GNUCASH_DIR. 

5. The content of $GNUCASH_DIR (as well as all the other binary
   packages) should then be copied to a windows machine. The paths
   in $GNUCASH_DIR/bin/gnucash and/or $GNUCASH_DIR/bin/gnucash.bat
   need to be adjusted for the installation location on the
   windows machine.

Good luck!
