These scripts try to download and install a Windows/mingw32 build
environment for GnuCash on Windows. 

For cross-compiling the windows executable on Linux, see the lower
section of this file.

Before you start with the automated build, you have to complete these
steps manually. The directory variables are set in custom.sh.

* Download MSYS (but *only* msys, no mingw and no msysdtk)
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> MSYS -> (bin, *.exe)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Install MSYS (no postinstall)
to $MSYS_DIR

* Download wget
from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml -> Current -> mingwPORT -> (bin, wget-*)
to $DOWNLOAD_DIR

* Adjust installer.sh and/or custom.sh. Especially in the latter you
  can comment out those build steps that have been completed already
  and/or should not be performed now. If you want verbose output of
  any script step, change the first line in install.sh and add the
  "-x" switch.

Start/Enter any MSYS shell. Let the automated build begin by:

  $INSTALLER_DIR/install.sh

Good luck!

Cross-compiling a Windows/mingw32 executable of GnuCash on a Linux
host system.

These steps need to be performed:

* Edit the file create_cross_mingw.sh and set the PREFIX= variable to
  the preferred prefix of the mingw32 gcc/binutils on your Linux. 

* Then run the script create_cross_mingw.sh - it will download,
  compile, and install a mingw32 toolchain.

* Run "dos2unix custom.sh install.sh" and in custom.sh, make a
  search&replace of '\\' into '/'.

* Edit custom.sh to set your preferred directory paths.
