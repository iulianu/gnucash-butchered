1999-11-21  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: (recordCB): when when record
	a new or existing transaction, make sure it will be in the
	date range we are viewing.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c: (gnc_table_traverse_update): handle
 	pointer traversals a bit more intelligently.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c: (item_edit_set_cursor_pos)
	fix for when you enter a cell that's right-aligned.
	
1999-11-20  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.[ch]: Use a hash table to remember
	reconcile flags after a refresh. Also remember scroll position.
	Change row styles so active row isn't highlited.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c:
 	(gnucash_button_press_event): For now, we need to enter the cell,
 	even if we're already there. The reconcile cell, for instance,
 	depends on this behavior. But, if we're entering the cell where we
 	already are, we remember the cursor position and try to go back to
 	it. Also, when we're entering a new cell it's drawn as if we're at
 	cursor position 0, so tell item_edit_set_cursor.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_draw_info):
 	new function to calculate drawing parameters for the item
 	editor. This is used both in drawing and in calculating the place
 	to move the cursor to for mouse traversals.
	(item_edit_draw): use item_edit_draw_info
	(item_edit_set_cursor_pos): use item_edit_draw_info

1999-11-19  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* gnucash-cursor.c (gnucash_item_cursor_draw): Use light gray for
 	the cell cursor; experimental to see if we like it.
	(gnucash_item_cursor_draw): Draw the inside rectangle slightly
 	inside.
	(gnucash_cursor_request_redraw): Tighten up the bounds now that we
 	don't have the outside rectangle.

	* gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_button_press_event): Only move the cursor
	if the button press moves us to a new cell.  Set the editing cursor.

	* gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_draw): Take justification into
 	account here.  Use CELL_HPADDING, CELL_VPADDING instead of magic
 	constants to set the clip rectangle and the offsets.
	(item_edit_set_cursor_pos): New function.
	(item_edit_update): Adjust the positioning of the list now that we
 	don't have the outer rectangle.

1999-11-19  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c: remember expansion state and
	scroll position after a refresh.

	* src/gnome/query-user.[ch]: add parented versions of the
	query dialogs.

	* src/gnome/: modify dialogs to use parented dialogs

1999-11-18  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/util.c: (PrtAmtComma): fixed rounding error
	when remainder is close to 1.

1999-11-12  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/util.c: (xaccSPrintAmount): print values
	very close to 0 as 0 without negative sign.

	* lib/README: updated to indicate obsolete packages.

	* lib/Makefile.in: don't build g-wrap if g-wrap-install
	directory exists

	* src/guile-util.c: (gnc_register_c_side_scheme_ptr):
	modified to return SCM handle, which is used with
	(gnc_unregister_c_side_scheme_ptr) to unregister.

	* src/gnome/option-util.c: added (gnc_options_init)
	and (gnc_options_shutdown).

	* src/gnome/top-level.c: call above functions at
	appropriate times.

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c: (gnc_account_tree_select_account):
	scroll to make sure account is visible.

1999-11-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-filebox.c: Use GtkFileSelection instead
	of GtkFileSelection2.

	* build: Changed configure.in/Makefile.in's to remove dependencies
	on gtkfilel2.

	* build: automatically rebuild gnc.[ch] when gnc.gwp changes *or*
	if you switch from motif to gnome build or vice versa.

	* src/gnome/window-main.: added Save As menu item.

1999-11-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/Refresh.c: Added this code for refreshing account-related
 	windows when accounts change. Right now, this is registers and
 	reconcile windows.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: fixed deleting of blank split
	
1999-11-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* Add this changelog entry which I should have done a long
	time ago.

	* Rework most of the src/gnome stuff to be compliant with
	gnome-standards.

	* Add QIF fixes.

	* Add Transfer and Adjust Balance windows.

	* Add gnome<->guile options interface.

	* Add c-side SCM registry, courtesy of Rob.

	* Add Alexandru's register window enhancements.

	* Add Heath's gnome register enhancements.

	* Remove dependencies on gtksheet. Hooray!

1999-08-25  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* Add ./README.gnome-hackers.

	* Add ./README.guile-hackers.

	* Add this file (./ChangeLog).  I'm planning to add change
	information here, and I invite others to do the same.  For those
	that use emacs, 'C-x 4 a' adds a new entry.  If people don't like
	this idea, we can drop it.

	* Add new scheme function gnc:choose-item-from-list-dialog.  There
	is C side code, but it's only meant to be called from scheme.
	This function is quite flexible in handles selections.  Eventually
	we might want to generalize this even more, but there are some GC
	issues to consider.  See src/gnome/query-user.c and gnc.gwp for
	details, and see src/scm/extensions.scm for an example usage.

	* IMPORTANT: queryBox signature has changed.  See the docs in
	src/gnome/query-user.c and in gnc.gwp for details.

	* Remove queryBox stubs from Motif side.  Motif doesn't support it
	(yet), and with gnc.gwp conditional inclusion we can just ignore
	it on the motif side.

	* Add function (current-gnc-compile-flavor) to gnc.gwp so that we
	can have conditional blocks.  Possible return values are 'gnome
	and 'motif.
