	* src/Refresh.c: Added this code for refreshing account-related
 	windows when accounts change. Right now, this is registers and
 	reconcile windows.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: fixed deleting of blank split

	* Add this changelog entry which I should have done a long
	time ago.

	* Rework most of the src/gnome stuff to be compliant with
	gnome-standards.

	* Add QIF fixes.

	* Add Transfer and Adjust Balance windows.

	* Add gnome<->guile options interface.

	* Add c-side SCM registry, courtesy of Rob.

	* Add Alexandru's register window enhancements.

	* Add Heath's gnome register enhancements.

	* Remove dependencies on gtksheet. Hooray!

1999-08-25  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* Add ./README.gnome-hackers.

	* Add ./README.guile-hackers.

	* Add this file (./ChangeLog).  I'm planning to add change
	information here, and I invite others to do the same.  For those
	that use emacs, 'C-x 4 a' adds a new entry.  If people don't like
	this idea, we can drop it.

	* Add new scheme function gnc:choose-item-from-list-dialog.  There
	is C side code, but it's only meant to be called from scheme.
	This function is quite flexible in handles selections.  Eventually
	we might want to generalize this even more, but there are some GC
	issues to consider.  See src/gnome/query-user.c and gnc.gwp for
	details, and see src/scm/extensions.scm for an example usage.

	* IMPORTANT: queryBox signature has changed.  See the docs in
	src/gnome/query-user.c and in gnc.gwp for details.

	* Remove queryBox stubs from Motif side.  Motif doesn't support it
	(yet), and with gnc.gwp conditional inclusion we can just ignore
	it on the motif side.

	* Add function (current-gnc-compile-flavor) to gnc.gwp so that we
	can have conditional blocks.  Possible return values are 'gnome
	and 'motif.
