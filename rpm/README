This directory contains spec files for building an RPM

Short instructions:

You'll need to be root.  (It is possible to avoid this requirement,
but I haven't done the work to the RPM.)

rpm -ivh <whatever>.src.rpm
cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
rpm -ba <whatever>.spec

wait a bit, and a new binary rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch> and a new src.rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.
