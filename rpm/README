This directory contains spec files for building an RPM

Short instructions:

You'll need to be root.  (It is possible to avoid this requirement,
but I haven't done the work to the RPM.)

cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
tar -zxvf xacc-1.x.tar.gz
cp xacc-1.x/rpm/xacc.spec ../SPECS
cp xacc-1.x/rpm/xacc.wmconfig .

cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
rpm -ba xacc.spec

wait a bit, and a new binary rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch> and a new src.rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.
