This directory contains spec files for building an RPM

Short instructions:

> I've never built an rpm; given a spec file, how do I do this?
> I understand the theory, just not clear on what to type up.

You'll need to be root.  (It is possible to avoid this requirement,
but I haven't done the work to the RPM.)

cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
tar -zxvf xacc-1.x.tar.gz
cp xacc-1.x/rpm/xacc.spec ../SPECS
cp xacc-1.x/rpm/xacc.wmconfig .

cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
rpm -ba xacc.spec

wait a bit, and a new binary rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch> and a new src.rpm will be in
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.


================================

JPL version:

1) Obtain a GnuCash distribution (source code .tar.gz file), 
   either by downloading from an ftp site somewhere, or building
   from CVS using "make dist".  The file should have the nomenclature
   gnucash-X.Y.Z.tar.gz where X.Y.Z are the release numbers.

2) Copy and uncompress/tar the distribution in your 
   /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES directory.  You will need to do this as the 
   root user.  Note, use your distribution-specific path here, only 
   redhat uses "/usr/src/redhat".

   cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
   cp /SOMEPATH/gnucash-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
   tar xvzf gnucash-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

3) Copy the rpm spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPEC.

   cp gnucash-X.Y.Z/rpm/gnucash.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/.
   
4) Edit the spec file, you probably will only need to modify the 
   following 3 lines, depending on what features you want to include 
   in the rpm:

   %define _with_postgres 0      (use postgres backend?)
   %define _with_ofx 0           (use openofx package?)
   %define _with_hbci 0          (use hbci package?)

5) Build the binary and source RPMs
   cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
   rpmbuild -ba gnucash.spec

   (note: older versions of rpm use "rpm -ba FILE.spec" to build) 
   
6) Wait a bit, and a new binary rpm will be in
   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch> and a new src.rpm will be in
   /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS.
