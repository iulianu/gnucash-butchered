    <h1>Accounts Payable &amp; Accounts Receivable</h1>

    <p> A/R (Accounts Receivable) and A/P (Accounts Payable) are
    somewhat deep to understand.</p>

    <p> Let us first examine A/R. After all, we really shouldn't
    really <em>need</em> to relate to A/P because we always pay
    <em>our</em> bills on time, don't we ? :-)</p>

    <p> So, as a first cut, let us assume we don't require
    customers to pay <em> instantly,</em> in cash, but rather issue
    them an invoice, and give them 30 days to pay the bills. (Then
    we can start charging interest and sending out harassing
    letters :-)).</p>

    <p> When we make a sale, the two accounts affected are <b>
    Sales</b> (an income account) and <b>Accounts Receivable.</b>
    Accounts Receivable is an asset, but it's not liquid, and it's
    not <em> quite</em> cash.</p>

    <p> Then when they come by to pay their bill, dropping off a
    large sack of twenty-dollar bills (or, more likely, a
    check/cheque), we transfer the amount from A/R to Cash.</p>

    <p> The reason we do this in two steps is that we've decided to
    do our accounting on an accrual basis and not on a cash basis,
    because most of our transactions are not solely based on cash
    changing hands, but rather based on <em> establishing
    obligations.</em></p>

    <p> In more sophisticated systems, there may be a whole
    sequence of documents generated and tracked:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A customer sends in a <b>Purchase Order</b>, thus
      authorizing a purchase.</li>

      <li>We set up a <b>Work Order</b> to schedule production of
      whatever the customer is buying</li>

      <li>We issue a <b>Shipping Notice</b>, to ship to goods to
      the customer</li>

      <li>Once shipped, we issue an <b>Invoice</b>, representing
      the <em> request to pay</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p> We report sales in our sales figures as soon as we make
    them, but if the auditor wants to know about whether we'll get
    stuck with bad debts, we break down those A/R's based on the
    "ages" of the debts, commonly segmented into three or four
    periods, of 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.</p>

    <p> At some point when a particular debt is "written off,"
    perhaps when the cheesing bastards go bankrupt, we dock both
    A/R and Sales, so we're going back and patching up (or rather,
    less happily, "patching down") the Sales account to show that
    the Sale was never made good. It is common to set up a <b> Bad
    Debt Expense</b> account so that such incidences are recorded
    in a way that makes it clearer that <em> sales went bad</em>
    .</p>

    <p> The above things, reversed, reflect how Accounts Payables
    work; just switch customer with supplier, and see how the roles
    reverse. If we buy materials "on account," accrual accounting
    requires that we record that we incur the expense immediately,
    and rather than reducing cash, we put the "credit" into the <b>
    Accounts Payable</b> account. Three weeks later, the invoice
    comes in, and we issue a payment, and so <em> Debit AP, Credit
    Cash.</em></p>

    <p> We can also use analagous techniques for expenses that we
    prepay. If we have to pay out down six months of rent in
    advance, that is treated as an "accrued asset," <b> Prepaid
    Rent,</b> and while it puts an unfortunate dent in the Cash
    account, it <em> does</em> show on the books as an asset that
    will decline over time to zero. Each month, we draw the account
    down via <em> Debit <b> Rent Expense</b>, Credit <b> Prepaid
    Rent</b>.</em> Similarly, we've been collecting payroll taxes
    from our employees and keeping them in a special bank account,
    <em> that</em> money is not really ours, so we have a growth in
    the Cash account on one side, and a growth in an Accrued
    Liability, namely, <b>Payroll Taxes Payable</b>, on the other
    side. When we send the quarterly check to the Government so
    that they can make <em> their</em> payroll, our <b> Payroll
    Taxes Payable</b> drops as does the balance in the <b>Checking
    Account</b>.</p>
