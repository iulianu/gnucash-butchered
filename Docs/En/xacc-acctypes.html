    <h1>Account Types</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Cash</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b>cash</b> account type is used to denote the cash
      that you store in your wallet, shoebox, piggybank, or
      mattress.</dd>

      <dt><b>Bank</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b>Bank</b> account type denotes a savings or
      checking account held at a bank or other financial
      institution.</dd>

      <dd>Such accounts sometimes bear interest.</dd>

      <dt><b>Credit</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b> Credit</b> card account is used to denote credit
      card accounts, whether involving floating lines of credit as
      with VISA, MasterCard, or Discover, as well as others like
      American Express that do <em> not</em> permit you to maintain
      continuing balances.</dd>

      <dd>The introduction of <a href= 
      "http://www.visa.com/pd/debit/checkcard.html"> Check
      Cards</a> where payments are withdrawn directly from a
      checking account makes the selection less clear; it is
      probably more appropriate to treat a "Check Card" as a <b>
      Bank</b> account, as it does withdraw amounts directly from
      such an account, not really involving any granting of
      credit.</dd>

      <dt><b>Asset, Liability</b></dt>

      <dd><b>Asset</b> and <b>Liability</b> accounts are used for
      tracking things that are of value, but that are not so
      directly translated into <em> cash</em> .</dd>

      <dd>For instance, you might collect the costs of purchasing a
      house into an asset account entitled <b> My House,</b> or the
      cost of a car into <b> My Car,</b> or collect together the
      value of your <b> Computer Equipment.</b></dd>

      <dd>And the home mortgage or car loan would be represented by
      liability accounts, <b> Home Mortgage</b> and <b> Car
      Loan</b>, to be drawn down as payments are made on these
      loans.</dd>

      <dd>If you hold assets for business purposes, their decline
      in value over time might be treated as a deduction for tax
      purposes, that deduction being called <a href= 
      "xacc-apprdepr.html#depr">Depreciation.</a></dd>

      <dd>On the other hand, if you own assets that <em>
      appreciate</em> in value over time, such as real estate,
      collectibles like paintings, and investments like shares in
      companies, you may see them appreciate in value, and have to
      recognize, for tax purposes, what are called <a href= 
      "xacc-apprdepr.html#appr"> Capital Gains.</a></dd>

      <dt><a name="stockacct"></a><b>Stock, Mutual Fund</b></dt>

      <dd>Securities that you invest in are a form of asset that
      are normally acquired with the express purpose of receiving
      income either in the form of dividends, interest, or <a href= 
      "xacc-apprdepr.html#appr"> Capital Gains.</a> There are a
      multitude of securities markets around the world, and
      securities that are widely enough traded can have pretty
      concrete values that may be analyzed on a day-to-day
      basis.</dd>

      <dd>
        Stock and Mutual Fund accounts are typically tracked in
        registers having three main columns: 

        <ul>
          <li>Price</li>

          <li>Number of shares</li>

          <li>Cost</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dd>
        In order to get <em> useful</em> information out of the
        register, it is necessary to have multiple "views" on the
        data so that you may assess such things as: 

        <ul>
          <li>Total Values by security</li>

          <li>Gains/Losses by security</li>

          <li>Return On Investment rates by security</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dd>More details may be found in the <a href=
      "xacc-ticker.html">Stock Ticker</a> section.</dd>

      <dt><b><a href="xacc-expense.html"> Income,
      Expense</a></b></dt>

      <dd><b> Income</b> and <b>Expense</b> accounts are used to
      collect incomes and expenses.</dd>

      <dt><b>Equity</b></dt>

      <dd><b>Equity</b> accounts are used to balance the balance
      sheet, indicating the portion of the "corporate" value
      represents <em> the net amount that the owners own.</em></dd>

      <dd>On a year-by-year basis, a computed value called <b>
      Retained Earnings</b> indicates the net value of the
      enterprise; it is generally considered a good thing when this
      value increases.</dd>

      <dt><a href="xacc-currency.html"> <b>Currency</b></a></dt>

      <dd><b> Currency Accounts</b> are used for trading
      currencies.</dd>

      <dd>In most ways, they behave like stocks, except that the
      only way that "income" may be gotten from them is from
      fluctuations in the relative values of currencies. Note that
      transfers cannot be made directly between two accounts
      denominated in different currencies. Such transfers may only
      be made into currency trading accounts.</dd>
