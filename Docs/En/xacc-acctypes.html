    <h1>Account Types</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Cash</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b>cash</b> account type is used to denote the cash
      that you store in your wallet, shoebox, piggybank, or
      mattress.</dd>

      <dt><b>Bank</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b>Bank</b> account type denotes a savings or
      checking account held at a bank or other financial
      institution. Such accounts often bear interest.</dd>

      <dt><b>Credit</b></dt>

      <dd>The <b> Credit</b> card account is used to denote credit
      card accounts, whether involving floating lines of credit as
      with VISA, MasterCard, or Discover, or others like American
      Express, that do not permit you to maintain continuing
      balances.</dd>

      <dd>The introduction of <a href= 
      "http://www.visa.com/pd/debit/checkcard.html"> Check
      Cards</a> where payments are withdrawn directly from a
      checking account makes the selection less clear; it is
      probably more appropriate to treat a "Check Card" as a <b>
      Bank</b> account, as it does withdraw amounts directly from
      such an account, not really involving any granting of
      credit.</dd>

      <dt><b>Asset, Liability</b></dt>

      <dd><b>Asset</b> and <b>Liability</b> accounts are used for
      tracking things that are of value, but that are not so
      directly like cash.</dd>

      <dd>For instance, you might collect the costs of purchasing a
      house into an asset account entitled <b> My House,</b> or the
      cost of a car into <b> My Car,</b> or collect together the
      value of your <b> Computer Equipment.</b></dd>

      <dd>And the home mortgage or car loan would be represented by
      liability accounts, <b> Home Mortgage</b> and <b> Car
      Loan</b>, to be drawn down as payments are made on these
      loans.</dd>

      <dt><b>Stock, Mutual Fund</b></dt>

      <dd>
        Stock and Mutual Fund accounts will typically be shown in
        registers which show three columns: 

        <ul>
          <li>Price</li>

          <li>Number of shares</li>

          <li>Value</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Income, Expense</b></dt>

      <dd><b> Income</b> and <b>Expense</b> accounts are used to
      collect incomes and expenses.</dd>

      <dt><b>Equity</b></dt>

      <dd><b>Equity</b> accounts are used to balance the balance
      sheet.</dd>

      <dt><a href="xacc-currency.html"> <b>Currency</b></a></dt>

      <dd><b> Currency Accounts</b> are used for trading
      currencies. In many ways, they behave like stocks, except
      that the computation of the value is different. Note that
      transfers cannot be made directly between two accounts
      denominated in different currencies. Such transfers may only
      be made into currency trading accounts. (Safety checks may be
      a bit broken still ... )</dd>
