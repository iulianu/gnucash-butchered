    <h1>Reconcile Window</h1>
    The Reconcile window is used to reconcile cleared transactins from
    a bank statement.  Enter a dollar amount from your last bank 
    statement in the box, and then click OK. The window will then show 
    all unreconciled transactions since your last bank statment.
    The reconcile window looks like this:

    The Reconcile window is for reconciling the user's records at the
    end of the month when the bank statement comes.  For example, if
    you write a check for something, enter the transaction.  When you
    know that the check has cleared, you can click the field between
    the description and payment fields, and it changes from a 'n' to
    a 'c', indicating the transaction has cleared.  At the end of the
    month, open the reconcile window, and xacc will prompt you to enter
    the ending balance from the bank statement.  Then the reconcile
    window will pop-up, and you will see a credit and a debit column
    that lists all the non-reconciled transactions.  You can then
    check off the transactions that appear in the bank statement, and
    verify the amount fields are correct.  At the bottom of the window
    is a difference field, which should be $0.00 when you are done
    reconciling.  If it isn't then you missed a transaction, or one
    of the amounts is wrong.  When you press "Ok", then the 'n' or
    'c' in the transactions that were checked off will change to a
    'y'.  When you change anything in a reconciled transaction, a
    verify dialog box should pop-up, but this doesn't seem to be
    happening anymore.  Also, the "cleared" total at the bottom seems
    to display $0.00 regardless of what transactions are cleared or
    reconciled.  The "cleared" total should display the total of only
    the transactions that have been cleared ('c') or reconciled ('y').
