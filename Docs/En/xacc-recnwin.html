    <h1>Reconciliation Window</h1>

    <p> The Reconciliation window is used to reconcile cleared
    transactions from a bank statement. Enter a dollar amount from
    your last bank statement in the box, and then click <tt>
    OK</tt> . The window will then show all unreconciled
    transactions since your last bank statment. The reconcile
    window looks like this:</p>

    <p><br>

    </p>

    <p> The Reconciliation window is used to reconcile the user's
    records at the end of the month. This involves validating the
    transactions in GnuCash against the transactions indicated on
    your bank statement.</p>

    <p> For example, when you write a check for something, you
    should enter the transaction into GnuCash.</p>

    <p> At the end of the month, you receive your bank statement,
    perhaps including cancelled checks. At <em> that</em> point,
    you should "reconcile" the account, that is, agree your
    personal records to the documentation provided by the bank.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Open the reconcile window, and GnuCash will prompt you to
      enter the ending balance from the bank statement.</li>

      <li>Then the reconcile window will pop-up, and you will see a
      credit and a debit column that lists all the non-reconciled
      transactions.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        Now, examine each item on the bank statement. 

        <p> If a check has cleared, as indicated by your bank
        statement, you should click the field between the
        description and payment fields, and it will then change
        from <tt>n</tt> to <tt>c</tt>, indicating the transaction
        has <b>c</b>leared.</p>

        <p> You then repeat this for each item that appears on the
        bank statement, verifying that the amounts match with the
        amounts in GnuCash, and marking off transactions in GnuCash
        as they are reconciled.</p>
      </li>

      <li>At the bottom of the window is a difference field, which
      should be $0.00 when you are done reconciling. If it isn't,
      then you have either missed transactions, or some amounts may
      be incorrect in GnuCash. (Or, probably rather less likely,
      the bank may have made an error.)<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>When you have completed marking off all the items on the
      bank statement, and when the difference heads to $0.00, you
      should press <tt>Ok</tt>, then the <tt>n</tt> or <tt>c</tt>
      in the transactions that were checked off will change to a
      <tt>y</tt>, indicating that they have been validated to agree
      between the bank statement and your own records.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you change anything in a transaction that has been
    reconciled, a dialog box warning you that such changes are
    unwise should pop up, but this doesn't seem to happen
    anymore.</p>

    <p> Also, the "cleared" total at the bottom seems to display
    <tt>$0.00</tt> regardless of what transactions are cleared or
    reconciled.</p>

    <p> The "cleared" total should display the total of only the
    transactions that have been cleared (<tt>c</tt>) or reconciled
    (<tt>y</tt>).</p>
