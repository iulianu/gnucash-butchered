    <title>Using Expense/Income Accounts</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h2>What is an Income/Expense Account?</h2>
    The words "Income" and "Expense" are beguilingly simple;
    everyone thinks they know what they mean. Don't let this fool
    you: they have a somewhat special meaning when applied to
    double-entry accounting. 

    <p> If you have used other personal finance software, be aware
    that <a href="xacc-quicken.html#QUICKENCATS"> Quicken calls
    them "Categories."</a></p>

    <p> In a double entry system, two kinds of accounts must be
    created: some of type "Income" and some of type "Expense".
    Income such as salary, wages, bank interest and stock dividends
    are then recorded as transfers from an income account to a bank
    (or generally, asset) account. Similarly, expenses are recorded
    as transfers from a credit card account (or generally, a
    liability account).</p>

    <p> Another way of describing the requirement for "double
    entry" is that when you receive an income, two things
    happen:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You receive a sum of <em> money,</em> and must record
      that effect on your bank account.</li>

      <li>You have received an income, and must record that effect
      on an income account.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Why are accounts of type "Income" and "Expense" considered
    special? The answer lies in the nature of double-entry. With a
    simple double-entry transaction, one account is always
    credited, and another account is always debited. When salary is
    deposited in a bank account, the bank account is credited, and
    the income account is debited, thus:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Account</th>

        <th>Debit</th>

        <th>Credit</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Chequing Account</td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Salary</td>

        <td>
        </td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This can be readily extended to a greater number of "split"
    items thus:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Account</th>

        <th>Debit</th>

        <th>Credit</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Chequing Account</td>

        <td>1,300.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Income Taxes</td>

        <td>200.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Health Plan</td>

        <td>100.00</td>

        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Salary</td>

        <td>
        </td>

        <td>1,600.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p> There may be a whole lot more than two entries in the
    transaction, but the total sum of the Debits, $1,600.00, still
    equals the total sum of the credits, $1,600.00.</p>

    <p> If, as with <b>X-Accountant,</b> everything is forced onto
    one column, so that <b> debits</b> are represented by positive
    values, and <b> credits</b> are represented by negative values,
    the income/expense accounts do a slightly non-intuitive thing
    and you see incomes as <em> negative</em> values. That <em>
    appear</em> contrary to intuition, but is necessary in order
    for balances to balance.</p>

    <p> Another way in which income and expense accounts are
    special is that their account totals do not appear on a balance
    sheet. A balance sheet shows "Net Worth": the sum of all assets
    minus all liabilities. Since income and expenses are neither
    assets nor liabilities, they do not appear on the balance
    sheet; only their effects on <b> equity.</b> There is a
    different kind of report, a "Profit and Loss" (P&amp;L) report,
    that shows income and expenses. The total profit (or loss) is
    the total income minus total expenses. Since assets and
    liabilities are neither income or expenses, they do not appear
    on a P&amp;L statement.</p>

    <p> Even though the accounts may be somewhat "special", you do
    not need to do anything particularly special to use income and
    expense accounts. X-Accountant handles the values
    automatically, so that if you record properly the effects of
    the transactions on your bank account or credit card, the
    income/expense side of the transaction should also be handled
    correctly. The time when things get "peculiar," and when you
    need to more deeply understand this, is when amounts are
    transferred between income/expense accounts. (The <i>
    causes</i> for such transfers tend to be somewhat peculiar, so
    it's pretty fair for this to be a pretty odd situation.)</p>

    <h2>Using Income/Expense Accounts</h2>

    <p> To use an income/expense account, simply create one from
    the "New Account" dialogue window, and then be sure to transfer
    income/expenses to it as you record paychecks, interest,
    etc.</p>

    <p> You will doubtless wish to create quite a number of income
    and expense accounts; it may be worth looking at the <a href= 
    "xacc-groups.html#SAMPLECHART"> Sample Chart of Accounts</a>
    for ideas.</p>

    <p> This partitioning of incomes and expenses proves
    particularly useful for North Americans when <i>income tax
    time</i> rolls around.</p>
