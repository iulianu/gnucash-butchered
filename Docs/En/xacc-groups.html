    <h1>Chart of Accounts</h1>
    Typically accounts are arranged as a tree, in heirarchical form. 
    The main trunks represent entire categories or groups, while the 
    leaves of the tree denote individual bank accounts or expense 
    categories.  When a summary report is requested, typically only 
    the main branches are shown in the report, not each of the 
    individual accounts.  For example, a chart of accounts might look 
    like the following:

<pre>
        300             Expenses
         |
         +--310         Living Expenses
         |   |
         |   +--311     Beer
         |   |
         |   +--312     Cable
         |
         +--320         Business Expenses
         |   |
         |   +--321     8-inch Floppies
         |   |
         :   :
</pre>

    Note that accounts are coded: when a report is generated,
    the sort order is determined entirely by the numbering.  
    By tradition and common practice, accounts that are not 
    leaf accounts have a number that ends in zero; each higher
    level has one more zero in the account code.

    <p>
    When you <a href="xacc-accwin.html">create a new account</a>,
    GnuCash offers a guess 
    at what it thinks the account code might be; you are free 
    to change this.  GnuCash does not prevent duplicate numbering, 
    although you are encouraged to avoid this.  Account codes
    are treated as numbers, base-36: thus, if you run out of numbers,
    you can use the letters, a through z. 
    

    <h2>A Bigger Example</h2>
    A "typical" chart of accounts is shown below.  Each account
    is of a given <a href="xacc-acctypes.html">account type</a>.
    This example is a combination of some typical business 
    and personal accounts.   
    <p>
