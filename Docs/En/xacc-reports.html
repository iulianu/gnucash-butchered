    <h1>Reports</h1>

    <p> There are presently two types of reports: a <b>Balance
    Sheet</b> and a <b>Profit and Loss Statement</b>.</p>

    <p> A Balance Sheet shows Assets, Liabilities and Equity. The
    sum of all Assets equals the sum of Liabilities and Equity.</p>

    <p> A Profit and Loss Statement shows <a href=
    "xacc-expense.html"> Income and Expenses.</a> The sum of all
    Income minus all expenses is the Profit or Loss, which is the
    change in equity for the period in question.</p>

    <p> The change in Equity from day to day (year to year)
    represents that day's (year's) profit or loss.</p>

    <h1> New Reporting System</h1>

    <p> <em> Note that a new reporting system with reports written
    in Scheme is under construction; once that starts to function,
    this document will need to be modified to describe how users
    are to use the reporting system.</em></p>

    <p><em> There will also be a need to construct documentation to
    indicate how to construct new reports using the reporting
    system.</em></p>
