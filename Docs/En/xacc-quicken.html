    <title>A Guide for Former Users of Quicken</title>

  <body>
    <h1>Quicken (TM) User's Guide</h1>

    <p> Not all accounting systems use the same words for the same
    concepts. The following are some notes that may be helpful to
    users accustomed to Intuit's products.</p>

    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <a name="QUICKENCATS"></a> 

    <p> What Quicken calls <tt>Categories</tt> are really just <a
    href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense accounts</a>. Thus, if
    you are used to specifying a category in Quicken, just create
    an income/expense account of the same name in X-Accountant, and
    use that as the name of the account.</p>

    <h2>Quicken QIF File Import</h2>
    <a name="QIF"> X-Accountant supports the import of Quicken
    Import Files (QIF). (Note: Only Quicken Version 3.0 QIF has
    been tested).</a> 

    <p> Note that the QIF format is representive of a somewhat
    peculiar data model that is not as expressive as one might
    wish; please read this section carefully, or you may be
    disappointed with the results.</p>

    <p> To create a Quicken QIF file, start Quicken (yes, it works
    on <a href="http://www.winehq.com/"> Wine,</a> and probably
    Wabi too), choose the menu "File" and select the <tt>
    Export...</tt> menu entry. Quicken can only export one account
    to each data file, which means that if you have many accounts,
    this may prove to be a somewhat tedious process. (On the other
    hand, it should be a whole lot <em> less</em> tedious than
    entering the data from scratch.)</p>

    <p>When exporting, note that there are a series of check boxes
    marked <tt>Transactions</tt>, <tt>Accounts List</tt>, <tt>
    Category List</tt>, and so forth. For best results, you will
    want to make sure that these three are checked. If you do <em>
    not</em> check the <tt>Accounts List</tt> box, then the name of
    your account will be lost.</p>

    <p> To import a Quicken QIF file, choose the menu <tt>File</tt>
    and select the entry <tt>Import QIF</tt>. The imported file
    will be merged with whatever other data you currently have in
    X-Accountant. This merge allows multiple Quicken accounts to be
    imported and merged into one account group.</p>

    <p> Note that during merge, a scan is made for duplicate
    transactions, and duplicates are removed. A duplicate
    transaction is one where the date, description (payee), memo,
    quantity, share price, and debited/credited accounts or
    categories match <em> exactly.</em> Thus, the merge should be
    safe unless you have multiple transactions on the same date, to
    the same account, for the same amount, with the same
    description and memo.</p>

    <p> This unfortunately <em> can</em> occur, the typical
    scenario involving where you make multiple withdrawals of
    identical amounts from ATM machines on the same day.</p>

    <p> An ongoing project is to build an alternative import
    utility in Guile that will be more flexible, and which, by
    virtue of being stored as a set of Scheme scripts, may be
    modified without needing to recompile the whole application. At
    this point, it successfully parses QIF files; what remains is
    the (rather complex task) of determine appropriate
    correspondences between the Quicken <b> Categories</b> and the
    GnuCash equivalents.</p>

    <p> Further details about the QIF Interchange Format may be
    found <a href= 
    "http://www.ntlug.org/~cbbrowne/financeformats.html#QIF">
    here.</a></p>

    <p> Note that when the <tt>Accounts List</tt> and <tt>Category
    List</tt> is exported from Quicken, <b>all</b> accounts and
    categories will be exported, even if they are empty and contain
    no transactions. When these are imported, they will appear as
    accounts with a balance of zero. If you do not plan to use such
    accounts, feel free to delete them. Future enhancements may
    allow you to delete them "en masse," or to make them invisible
    without deleting them.</p>
