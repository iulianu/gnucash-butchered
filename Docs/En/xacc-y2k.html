    <h1>GnuCash Y2K Readiness</h1>

    <p> Gnucash version 1.1.25 and later store all dates as seconds
    and nanoseconds, where the seconds are stored in a 64-bit
    signed integer. This should suffice to store dates in the
    distant past as well as the distant future, as long as they are
    less than several dozen times the present estimates of the age
    of the universe.</p>

    <p> The file format for version 1.1.25 and later stores dates
    in the above-described fashion.</p>

    <p> Some internal routines use the <tt>time_t</tt> type to
    express seconds. Note that on most OSes, this is a 32-bit
    quantity, and is limited to the Unix epoch, roughly December
    1901 thru Jan 2038. It is reasonable to expect that this will
    migrate to 64 bit values by that time.</p>

    <p> Backup and log files are time-stamped using the standard
    Unix <tt>ctime()</tt> routine, which takes a <tt>time_t</tt>
    argument. Thus, the backup and log mechanism may experience
    trouble in 2038, assuming your Unix continues to be in service
    at that time without remediation.</p>

    <p> Note that GnuCash also correctly recognizes February 29th,
    2000 as a "leap day," another of the "critical Y2K dates."</p>

    <p>Y2K issues are described in more detail at <a href= 
    "http://www.ntlug.org/~cbbrowne/linuxy2k.html"> Linux and Year
    2000.</a></p>
