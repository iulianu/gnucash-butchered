    <h1>GnuCash Y2K Readiness</h1>

    <p> GnuCash versions 1.1.25 and later store all dates as
    seconds and nanoseconds, where the seconds are stored in a
    64-bit signed integer. This should suffice to store dates into
    both the distant past as well as the distant future, so long as
    they fall not <em> too</em> many orders of magnitude outside
    cosmologists' estimations of the age of the universe.</p>

    <p> The file format for version 1.1.25 and later stores dates
    in the above-described fashion.</p>

    <p> Some internal routines use the <tt>time_t</tt> type to
    express seconds. Note that on most OSes, this is a 32-bit
    quantity, and is thus limited to the Unix epoch, roughly
    December 1901 thru Jan 2038. It is reasonable to expect that
    <tt> time_t</tt> will migrate to the use of 64 bit values by
    that time.</p>

    <p> Backup and log files are time-stamped using the standard
    Unix <tt>ctime()</tt> routine, which takes a <tt>time_t</tt>
    argument. Thus, the backup and log mechanism may experience
    trouble in 2038, assuming your present Unix continues to be in
    service at that time without any remediation.</p>

    <p> Note that GnuCash also correctly recognizes February 29th,
    2000 as a "leap day," another of the "critical Y2K dates."</p>

    <p> This is all highly suggestive that GnuCash should cope
    reasonably well with the transition to the new millennium,
    whether that take place in 2000 or in 2001...</p>
