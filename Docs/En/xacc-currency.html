    <h1> Double Entry Bookkeeping</h1>

    <p>A Double Entry bookkeeping system stores both values, and
    requires that all transactions balance:</p>

    <p>Double entry states that <tt> value1+value2+value3+ ... =
    0</tt> where each value is recorded in a different account.</p>

    <p> A value is</p>

    <ul>
      <li>value=exch-rate*amount (for currency accounts) <i>
      value=price*num-shares (for stocks/mutual-funds)</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Thus, buying a widget in Japan and using US Dollars to
    pay for it would appear thus:</i></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <i> <b>SpendAcct:</b> (an ordinary bank/cash acct valued in
        USD)</i> 
<pre>
<i>Date      xfer from       memo                cost
1/5/99    [YenAcct]       Buy widget          $1.00
</i>
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i> <b>YenAcct</b>: (a currency trading account valued in
        yen)</i> 
<pre>
<i>Date      xfer from       memo                purchase   rate
1/5/99    [SpendAcct]     Buy widget          Y150       0.00667
</i>
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>The engine links together all three of these values (1.0,
    150, 0.00667) permanently and makes it imposssible to change
    one without changing another, so that the grand total is always
    zero.</i></p>
