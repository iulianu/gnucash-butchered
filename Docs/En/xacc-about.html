    <h1>About GnuCash</h1>

    <hr>
    
    GnuCash is a program to keep track of your finances.  Its 
    features include:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple accounts, which can be open at
	the same time.  Create one xacc account
	for each of your bank accounts.
      <li>Each account keeps a running balance and
	a reconciled balance, so you can keep track
	of the checks that have cleared your account.
      <li>A simple interface.  If you can use the
	register in the back of your checkbook,
	you can use xacc.
      <li>Automatic account reconciling.  At the end
	of the month, open up the reconcile window,
	enter your bank statement's ending balance,
	and check off the transactions that appear
	in the bank statement.  This makes it easy
	to track down any discrepancies.
      <li>QuickFill... if you begin typing 
	in the description field, and the text matches a
	previous transaction, hitting TAB will copy
	that previous transaction.  Handy if you have
	similar transactions on a regular basis.
      <li>Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolios.  Track stocks
        individually (one per account) or in portfolio
        of accounts (a group of accounts that can be 
        displayed together).  
      <li>Support for multiple currencies and currency 
        trading accounts. (partial, still broken).
        Bank accounts may be established in different
        currencies, and trades with indicated prices 
        may be made, much as stocks would be traded.
      <li><a href="xacc-quicken.html">Quicken File Import</a>.
        Import Quicken Version 3.0 QIF files.
      <li><a href="xacc-reports.html">Reports</a>. Display
        or output as HTML Balance or Profit&amp;Loss reports.
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
    GnuCash offers some features not usually found
    in simpler accounting programs.
    <ul>
      <li>Sub-accounts: A master account can have a hierarchy
        of detail accounts underneath it.  This allows similar
        account types (e.g. Cash, Bank, Stock) to be grouped 
        into one master account (e.g. Assets).
      <li><a href="xacc-double.html">Double Entry</a>: 
        Every transaction can appear in two
        accounts; one account is debited and the other is 
        credited with exactly the same amount.  With 
        double-entry, a transaction edited in one window 
        will be automatically updated in all other windows 
        showing that transaction, and in both of the 
        accounts.
      <li><a href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense Account Types
        (Categories)</a>.   When used properly 
        with the double-entry feature, these can be used 
        to create both Balance Sheet and Profits &amp; Losses
        reports.  For example, savings account interest,
        stock dividends, or paychecks can be marked as 
        both a deposit in a bank account, and as income in 
        an Income account type, using the double-entry 
        (transfer) feature.  Similarly, credit card charges
        can be noted in the credit card account, as well 
        as in a corresponding expense account.
      <li>General Ledger: Multiple accounts can be displayed 
        in one register window at the same time.  This can
        ease the trouble of tracking down typing/entry errors.
        It also provides a convenient way of viewing a
        portfolio of many stocks, by showing all transactions
        in that portfolio.
    </ul>

    <h2>Version</h2>
    This version is gnucash-1.3.x, a somewhat unstable, buggy version.
    The latest stable release is 1.2.x, you should be using that.
    <p>
    Versions 1.0.x and 1.2.x are considered to be stable revisions with all
    currently known bugs fixed.  Versions 1.3.x are considered to be
    development versions, which may have many bugs.  The next stable 
    series will be 1.4.x

    <h2>Lead Developers</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>Robin Clark &lt;rclark@hmc.edu&gt;
    <dd>wrote the original X-Accountant in Motif
       as a school project, taking it to version 0.9 by October 1997.

    <dt>Linas Vepstas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt;
    <dd>liked what he saw: the GUI was slick,
       the code was documented and well structured, and it was all GPL'ed.
       And so he re-wrote it: adding cell-widgets to XbaeMatrix, so that
       the combobox and arrows would make an even slicker GUI, rewrote the
       X-Accountant internals to add double-entry, an account heirarchy,
       split out a transaction mini-engine, add support for stocks, and spiff
       up the help menus.  This was version 1.0 as of January 1998.  Since
       then, for version 1.1, the engine was expanded &amp; refined, and the
       register window code completely redesigned and made mostly
       Motif-(and GUI-)independent.  Did some prototype OFX work.

    <dt>Jeremy Collins &lt;jcollins@gnucash.org&gt;
    <dd>publicized the GnoMoney project
       widely and broadly, and then changed its name to GnuCash.  Jeremy
       created the gnucash.org web site, registered the domain, got the
       initial GTK/gnome code working.

    <dt>Rob Browning &lt;rlb@cs.utexas.edu&gt;
    <dd>abused everyone for not using perl,
       and then added guile/scheme support. Rob maintains the build
       infrastructure, is handling the whole guile/perl extension language
       thing, and is dealing with configuration &amp; configurability.

    <dt>Dave Peticolas
    <dd>did a whole lot and should write a bio here.
