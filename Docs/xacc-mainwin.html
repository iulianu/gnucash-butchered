    The "Open Subaccounts" menu item is interesting only if
    you choose an account with sub-accounts (detail accounts).
    Accounts with sub-accounts will always have arrows on thier 
    left.  By choosing the "Open Subaccounts" menu item, a
    general ledger window is opened, which displays all transactions
    for the lead and the detail accounts.  Note that the
    general ledger window is more complicated and harder to use than
    the individual account registers.  The general ledger window
    allows a more comprehensive overview of accounts in a smaller
    space.  Because of its increased complixity, it use is recommended
    only for accounting experts.
