    <h1>Reports</h1>
    There are two types of reports: a <b>Balance Sheet</b> and 
    a <b>Profit and Loss Statement</b>.
    <p>
    A Balance Sheet shows Assets, Liabilities and Equity.  The sum of 
    all assets should equal the sum of Liabilities and Equity.
    <p>
    A Profit and Loss Statement shows Income and Expenses.  The
    sum of all Income minus all expenses is the Profit or Loss.
    <p> 
    The change in Equity from day to day (year to year) should 
    equal that day's (year's) profit or loss.
