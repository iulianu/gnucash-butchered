    <h1>Printing and Web Serving</h1>
    Currently, GnuCash does not support any sort of printer output.
    However, you can create a printout of the register window contents
    by opening a register window and selecting "Print... To File" from the
    "File" menu.  
    <p>
    Following the latest fashionable trends, GnuCash can also act as a 
    cheesy web server!  From an open register window, select 
    "Print ... To WWW" from the "File" menu.  Then aim your browser at
    <tt>http://localhost:1080/</tt> or 
    <tt>http://yourmachinename.com:1080/</tt>and you will see your 
    register window.  But, remember, we said "cheesy": to view the 
    page again, you have to pick the menu item again.
