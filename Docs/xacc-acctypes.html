    <h1>Account Types</h1>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Bank</b>
        <dd>The bank account type denotes a savings or checking account
            held at a bank.  Often interest bearing. 
    <dt><b>Cash</b>
        <dd>The cash account type is used to denote a shoe-box or pillowcase
            stuffed with cash.
    <dt><b>Credit</b>
        <dd>The Credit card account is used to denote credit (e.g. amex) and
            debit (e.g. visa, mastercard) card accounts.
    <dt><b>Asset, Liability</b>
        <dd>Asset and liability accounts indicate generic, generalized accounts
            that are none of the above.
    <dt><b>Stock, Mutual Fund</b>
        <dd>Stock and Mutual Fund accounts will typically be shown in registers
            which show three columns: price, number of shares, and value.
    <dt><b>Income, Expense</b>
        <dd>Income and expense accounts are used to denote income and expenses.
            Thus, when data in these accounts are displayed, the sign of the
            entries is reversed from its usual meaning.
    <dt><b>Equity</b>
        <dd>Equity account is used to balance the balance sheet.
   
    <dt><b>Currency</b>
        <dd>Currency Accounts are used for trading currencies.
            In many ways, they behave like stocks, except that the computation
            of the value is different.  Note that transfers cannot be made
            directly between two accounts denominated in different currencies. 
            Such transfers may only be made into currency trading accounts.
