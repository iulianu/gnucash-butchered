  <h2>What is an Income/Expense Account?</h2>
    The words "Income" and "Expense" are beguilingly simple; everyone 
    knows what they mean.  Don't let this fool you: they have a 
    special meaning when applied to double-entry accounting.
    <p>
    To properly record income and expenses in a double entry system,
    two special accounts must be created: one of type "Income" and one
    of type "Expense".   Income such salary, wages, bank interest and
    stock dividends are then recorded as transfers from an income
    account to a bank (or generally, asset) account.  Similarly,
    expenses are recorded as transfers from a credit card account
    (or generally, a liability account).
    <p>
    Why are accounts of type "Income" and "Expense" considered 
    special?  The answer lies in the nature of double-entry.
    With a double-entry transaction, one account is always credited,
    and another account is always debited.  When salary is deposited
    in a bank account, the bank account is credited, and the 
    income account is debited.  In order to make income appear
    positive (as it is), and expenses look negative, the meaning 
    of "debit" and "credit" is reversed for income and expense 
    accounts.  This makes them special.  
    <p>
    Another way in which income and expense accounts are special
    is that their account totals do not appear on a balance 
    sheet.  A balance sheet shows "Net Worth": the sum of all 
    assets minus all liabilities.  Since income and expenses are
    neither assets nor liabilities, they do not appear on the 
    balance sheet.  There is a different kind of report, a 
    "Profit and Loss" (P&L) report, that shows income and 
    expenses.  The total profit (or loss) is the total income 
    minus total expenses.  Since assets and liabilities are neither 
    income or expenses, they do not appear on a P&L statement.
    <p>
    Even though the accounts may be "special", you do not need 
    to do anything "special"
    to use income and expense accounts.  Everything is handled
    automatically, as long as you remember to transfer income
    and expenses between income/expense accounts and ordinary
    bank/asset/credit-card/liability accounts.

  <h2>Using Income/Expense Accounts</h2>
    To use an income/expense account, simply create one from the 
    "New Account" dialogue window, and then be sure to transfer
    income/expenses to it as you record paychecks, interest, etc.
    <p>
    If you have a complex account arrangement, you may want to 
    create multiple income/expense accounts.  One can be used to
    record salary, and only salary, another to record only bank 
    interest, and a third only to record stock dividends.  This 
    partitioning is particularly useful when tax-time rolls around.

  <h2>Notes</h2>
    Users of Quicken (TM) products should realize that what Quicken
    calls "Categories" are really just Income/Expense accounts.
    Thus, if you are used to specifying a category in Quicken, 
    just create an income/expense account of the same name in
    X-Accountant, and use that.
