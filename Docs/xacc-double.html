  <h2>What is Double Entry?</h2>
    Double entry is an accounting methodology used by proffesionals
    to make sure that all accounts are properly balanced.  When accounts
    balance, the likelyhood that a data-entry error has been made is much 
    less.  For large, complex accounts with many transactions, it is easy 
    to make errors that might go undetected for a long time. Double-entry
    is a crucial technology for catching those errors.
    <p>
    A dobule-entry transaction is a transaction that appears in two 
    accounts.  One account is debited by an amount exactly equal to 
    what the other is credited.  Thus, all transactions are always 
    transfers between two accounts.  Since they always appear with
    a plus sign in one account, and a minus sign in the other, the
    total over all accounts will always be zero, and thus, balanced
    accounts are guarenteed.
    <p>
    Double-entry is already familiar to most people as a transfer 
    from one bank account to another, where money is withdrawn from 
    one and deposited in another.  Far less familiar is the idea that 
    double entry can be used to track income and expenses as well as 
    bank transfers.  See the 
    "<a href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense</a>" help window 
    for more information.

  <h2>Using Double Entry</h2>
    To use the double entry, click on a box in the column marked
    "Transfer From" on the left-hand side of the register.  A menu
    will drop down, listing all of the accounts from which a transfer 
    may be made.   Select one.  When you record the transaction,
    the double-entry will automatically be made, and the transaction 
    automatically appear in all windows showing the transfered-from
    and the transferred-to accounts.
    <p>
    To change a double-entry transaction, edit it in any window in 
    which it appears.  Any changes made will be automatically 
    reflected in both accounts and all windows displaying the
    transaction.   Similarly, when a double-entry transaction is 
    deleted, it is deleted from both accounts; blanaces are
    automatically recalculated for both accounts.
    <p>
    To change the transfer account, simply select a new account 
    from the pull-down menu.  When you record the transaction, 
    it will automatically be delected from the old account, and 
    inserted into the new account.
