  <h1>Quicken (TM) User's Guide</h1>
    Not all accounting systems use the same words for the same
    concepts.  Below follows some notes for
    users accustomed to Quicken products.

  <h2>Categories</h2>
    What Quicken calls "Categories" are really just 
    <a href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense accounts</a>.
    Thus, if you are used to specifying a category in Quicken, 
    just create an income/expense account of the same name in
    X-Accountant, and use that as a category. 

  <h2>Quicken QIF File Import</h2>
    X-Accountant supports the import of Quicken Import Files
    (QIF). (Note: Only Quicken Version 3.0 QIF has been tested).
    Due to the curious nature of QIF, please read this section 
    carefully, or you may be disappointed with the results.
    <p>
    To create a Quicken QIF file, start Quicken (yes, it works
    Wine, and probably Wabi too), choose the menu "File"
    and select the "Export..." menu entry.  Under Quicken 
    Version 3.0, you can only export one account at a time, 
    and thus, exporting will prove to be a tedious process.
    When exporting, note that there are a series of check 
    boxes marked "Transactions", "Accounts List", "Category
    List", etc.  For best results, you will want to make
    sure that these three are checked.  If you do *not*
    check the "Accounts List" box, then the name of your
    account will be lost.
    <p>
    To import a Quicken QIF file, choose the menu "File"
    and select the entry "Import QIF".  The imported wile 
    will be merged with whatever other data you currently
    have in X-Accountant.  This merge allows multiple
    Quicken accounts to be imported and merged into 
    one account group.  Note that during merge, a scan 
    is made for duplicate transactions, and duplicates 
    are removed.  A duplicate transaction is one 
    where the date, description (payee), memo, quantity, share price,
    and debited/credited accounts or categories match exactly.
    Thus, the merge should be safe unless you have multiple
    transactions on the same date, to the same account,
    for the same amount, with the same description and memo.
    <p>
    Note that when the "Accounts List" and "Category List"
    is exported from Quicken, <b>all</b> accounts and 
    categories will be exported, even if they are empty,
    and contain no transactions.  When these are imported,
    they will appear as accounts with a balance of zero.
    If you do not need or use these accounts, delete them.
    A future X-Accountant enhancement will allow you to
    delete them en-masse, or to make them invisible without
    deleting them.
