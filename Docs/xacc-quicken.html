  <h1>Quicken User's Guide</h1>
    Not all accounting systems use the same words for the same
    concepts.  Below follws some notes for
    users accustomed to Quicken (TM) products.

  <h2>Categories</h2>
    What Quicken calls "Categories" are really just 
    <a href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense accounts</a>.
    Thus, if you are used to specifying a category in Quicken, 
    just create an income/expense account of the same name in
    X-Acccountant, and use that as a category.
