    Gnucash version 1.1.25 and later store all dates as seconds and
    nanoseconds, where the seconds are stored in a 64-bit signed integer.
    This should suffice to store dates in the distant past as well as the
    distant future, as long as they are less than several dozen times the 
    age of the universe.
    <p>
    The file format for version 1.1.25 and later stores dates in the 
    above-described fashion.
    <p>
    Some internal routines use the <tt>time_t</tt> type to express
    seconds.  Note that on most OS'es, this is a 32-bit quantity, and 
    is limited to the Unix era (Dec 1901 to Jan 2038).  
    <p>
    Backup and log files are time-stamped using the standard Unix
    <tt>ctime()</tt> routine, which takes a <tt>time_t</tt> argument.
    Thus, the backup and log mechanism may experience trouble in 2038.
