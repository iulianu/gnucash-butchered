<h1>GnuCash Project Goals</h1>

The people behind <a href="http://gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> 
aim to create a world-class GPL'ed Open Source Personal Financial 
Application for GNU/Linux and other Unix's.   This page aims to review
some of the technical and development issues surrounding this product,
to be a kind of 'FAQ' for developers and contributors.
To get a better idea of what <a href="http://gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> 
is and what it does, visit it's <a href="http://gnucash.org">home page</a>.
<p>
There are currently several different versions of GnuCash.  The current 
stable, production release is gnucash-1.2.x and is Motif based.  However,
development has all but switched entirely over to Gnome; the Motif version
will probably eventually fall to the wayside.  (Note that other versions, such as KDE,
Java or PalmPilot have been discussed and/or started. More about this below).
The latest Gnome version, and any latest version in general, is currently 
available only via CVS.   There are precompiled versions available, but these
are usually only for the stable releases.  Don't use the unstable versions 
unless you are looking for excitement and adventure.
<p>
This document is divided into several sections.  The first deals with 
archititectural and philosophical design issues. The second deals with 
interesting technologies.  The third deals with desirable features and
functions. 
<p>


<h2>Architectural Goals</h2>
There are some over-reaching design principles and philosophies that
we hope to maintain.  Some of these concepts and terms are introduced
in this section.
<p>
First, one must maintain a clean separation between the data structures 
and the GUI that manipulates them, along the lines of a 
<b>Model-View-Controller</b>
paradigm.   Lists of accounts and the transactions in
them can be thought of as a representation of financial data,
a <b>Model</b>.   The GUI that adds, modifies and deletes these should 
be thought of as a manipulator of the data, a <b>Controller</b>.  
The Motif or Gnome GUI's are just two
possible manipulators of the data; others, based on <i>e.g.</i> Qt/KDE,
emacs, Java applets or Java servlets should be possible.
<p>
The <b>View</b> of the data is a subset or slice of the data described
by the Model.  The View may consist of only the transactions for the 
month of May, or only the account totals for certain accounts.  The 
View is used in part to generate the reports and graphs, but it is 
also that which the Controller interacts with.
<p>
However, GnuCash also needs to deal with multiple distributed data 
sources: stock quotations from the net or transaction confirmations
from online banks and brokerage houses,  or more mundane sources, 
such as file imports, or merger of data from several users.  In this 
language, the concept of a global Model-View is dated, and somewhat 
inappropriate.  Rather, one is worried about how data is represented
in the local address space of the GUI, how the GUI manipulates it,
how date is brought in and merged from external sources, and how that
data is again output, whether to a file or a local or remote database.
Thus, the View is essentially a local data cache: its the data that
is immediately present and being displayed, reported, and manipulated.
The Model is the abstraction of that data that the GUI (the controller)
can act on.
<p>
In GnuCash, the Model is implemented via the <b>Engine</b> API, and
the View is the data that is currently in the <b>Engine</b>.  Thus,
the Engine is a set of programming API's that the GUI (or a script,
or even a clever command-line-addict) can use to manipulate the data.
Currently, the Engine is fairly poor, and matches the data types and 
formats that the GUI can manipulate.  These include transactions, 
transaction entires (splits), accounts and account heirarchies.
The Engine has a very simple apply/commit model, and a simple 
query mechanism for generating reports and views.
The Engine currently handles only a small set of data sources: 
it can import and merge in QIF's, it can read and write its own 
binary byte stream, and can get stock quotes from the net. 
However, since the Engine is meant to be the interface between 
the GUI and the financial data, it is meant to be able to do much more.
<p>
In particular, it should be possible to back the Engine onto an 
SQL dataabase, and thereby enable multiple users and/or intrface 
to more complex accounting ssytems.  The engine should also be 
expandable to handle other sources of data, such os OFX, 
Integrion GOLD, the Open Trading Protocol, the OMG CORBA
General Ledger submission, the IBM San Francisco business objects, 
or closer to home, Linux Kontor.  In particular, it should
be possible to use GnuCash not only to view data from these sources,
but also to manipulate it and send it back.  
<p>
The above structure then leads one to view GnuCash not so much as
a tightly integrated application, but a loose federation of parts
objects, libraries and interfaces.  In order to facilitate the 
glueing together of these parts, as well as simplify the questions 
of customizablity, change and rapid development, GnuCash makes use 
of an extension language to glue the pieces together. The extension
language that is most central to Gnucash is Scheme, although some
of the interfaces are also available through Perl.

<h2>Under construction</h2>
The stuff below dates back to Summer 1998 and is hrribly out of date. 

<h2>Feature Requirements</h2>
Create both a personal-financial accounting system, as well as a
business accounting framework.  Although these two goals may seem at
odds with each other, there is no reason why they could not share
a considerable amount of framework.  The goals of a personal finance
system is a system that is easy to use, has a simple yet powerful menu
system, provides graphs, charts, and interfaces to on-line banking and
stock systems.  The goals of a business system is multi-user
capabilities built on an SQL database and/or CORBA objects for 
multi-user use,  with support for inventory control, shipping &
receiving, billing, accounts payable & receivable.  A pie-in-the-sky
system might even include interfaces to on-line shopping carts, 
credit-card clearing interfaces, or even a subset of SAP R/3 (TM)
functions.  Note that all of these systems require at their base
both a strong model of a "financial transaction", as well as 
a ledger window, and a report generation mechanism.   The tools
created to allow one should be portable enough to be deployed in the
other application as well.
<p>


<h2>Features and Functions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Graphs, Reports</b>
<dd>Add the whole host of reports, including Net Worth statements,
    Balance Sheets, and Profit & Loss statements.  These should be
    printable: it might be best to create them as ordinary HTML pages,
    and use the printing abilities of the browser.  In an ideal
    situation, the user should be able to create custom reports.
    <p>
    Other output format possibilities include SGML and XML.  In the
    long run, these are preferable to HTML, since DSSSL and 
    <a href="http://www.jclark.com/jade/"> Jade (James DSSSL Engine</a>
    can be used to convert to RTF, Postscript, etc.  XML is the wave 
    of the future.
    <p>
    The Report Generator should be a "dockable" subsystem of the 
    whole.  Thus, it should be possible to run the report generator
    in a stand-alone, read-only fashion without having to start up the main
    application.
    <p>
    Graphs, charts, etc. too ...
    <p>
    One hard part of reporting is designing a configurable interface,
    so that people can build custom reports.  
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Simple HTML output is implemented. GnuCash will even act as a one-shot
        web server.
    <li>Reports for profit & loss, balance sheet, & portfolio valuation
        implemented as html-embedded perl scripts.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Web Site Maintenance & Marketing</b>
<dd>Put together an active, relevent web site.  Mailing list archives.
    Screen shots.  Announces on c.o.l.a, freshmeat.  Put minor news items, 
    etc. on web site news.  Bug tracker. Maintain repository of 
    co-requisite tools & packages.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Jeremy Collins 
        <a href="mailto:jcollins@gnucash.org">jcollins@gnucash.org</a> 
        has put together the web site and is the current maintainer.
        Almost everything on the list above is now available. Thanks Jeremy!
    <li>Dec 1998 -- Yannick LE NY has provided French tranlations of the 
        lead web pages.
    <li>Nov 1998 -- Many thanks to Patrick Condron 
         &lt;pcondon@rackspace.com&gt;
         and <b><tt>rackspace.com</tt></b> forgh-bandwidth hosting of the web 
        site.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>OFX support</b>
<dd>Provide the SGML DTD parsers to handle the OFX reports that many
    banking institutions are providing, or will soon be providing, to
    retail customers.  See below for OFX references.  OFX is an open spec
    from Microsoft, Intuit, & Checkfree, and will be supported by Integrion.
    The OFX DTD's are included in the 1.1 distributions. See 
    <a href="http://www.ofx.net">OFX HomePage</a> for details.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Work on an OFX DTD parser has begun.  headers generated
        correctly.  Constrcutors generated almost correctly.
        Parser work done by Linas.
    <li>Simple scripts have been run against real-live OFX servers.
        Ueli Rutishauser &lt;urutishauser@bigfoot.com&gt;
        has been able to do e*trade transactions to a real account.
    <li> how it will intereact with the GUI is a wide-open question.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Budgeting</b>
<dd>Ability to handle budgeted future transactions.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>A design doc has been submitted by Bob Drzyzgula.  
        Take a look at <tt>./src/budget.txt</tt> in the source directory.
    <p>

<dt><b>Ledger Widget</b>
<dd>Create a more powerful ledger widget.  Currently, the X-Accountant
    uses the powerful XbaeMatrix widget to display the ledger windows.
    This is a good widget for displaying and maintaining tables.  
    However, it could, and should, be further customized to handle 
    the needs of accounting use.  Thus, it should be possible to
    designate cells as being date cells, and provide completely
    automated handling of date entry within these cells. Similarly,
    it should be possible to designate monetary cells which can handle
    input.  General text fields, for the description and the memo,
    should be endowed with quick-fill abilities, allowing completion
    by comparing the current types text to previous entries.  Finally,
    there should be pull-down (combo-box) cells that can contain
    pull-down item lists.  Each of these functions are currently
    implemented in X-Accountant; however, there is no separation between
    these features and the specific accounting functions.  A clean
    separation would make the design and implementation of new ledger
    windows much simpler and easier.
    <p>
    <b>Current Status:</b> the latest beta-development releases (version 
    1.1.x) contain such an object.  
    <ul>
    <li>Currently Motif-based
    <li>GTK port mostly work, but is hung up on the inadequacies of 
        underlying table widget.
    <li>No Qt port yet of the register.
    <li>the simple single-account ledgers (incl. stock ledgers) seem 
        to be working correctly, but no heavy testing yet.
    <li>The multiple-account ledger is very broken.
    <li>The multi-split ledger seems to work.  One can display
        one line per transaction, two lines per transaction, one line 
        per split, or a dynamic-expansion version of these.
    <li>GTK version published, thanks to Rob Browning.
        (other comments above are for motif version).
    <li>No curses or emacs version yet.
    <li>Taxes: For handling e.g. new zealand GST tax (12.5%) or british VAT,
        it would be enough to add a checkbox to say y/n, add tax ...
        (of course other schemes would be more sophisticated.)
    <li>Linas Vepstas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt; is handling the "GUI-independent" 
        parts of the register, as well as the Motif code.
    <li>Ted Lemon &lt;mellon@hoffman.vix.com&gt;
        is creating/fixing/extending
        the underlying gtk widget to have the features that GnuCash needs.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Engine, Financial Objects</b>
<dd>The current system makes a distinction between the data (account,
    transaction) and they GUI that displays it.  The data is embeded 
    within and controlled by the "Engine", which is a set of routines
    to access accounts, transactions, etc.  The flexibility and features 
    of the engine can be improved, and in particular, the sophistication of 
    the query generator, and the level of multiple-currency support.
    But possibly the most important task is to review the paradigm
    and adjust it to bring it in line with a transaction-processing 
    model.
    <p>
    <b>Current Status:</b> 
    <ul>
    <li>The basic engine has been detangled from 
        the GUI elements, as of version gnucash-1.1.4.  
    <li>Binary file I/O mostly detangled into a separate module.
    <li>Crude transaction logging in place; should be suitable
        for error/crash recovery but has not been tried by fire.
    <li>Backup files automatically created & timestamped.
    <li>BeginEdit()/RoolbackEdit()/CommitEdit() routines mostly in place,
        These "Transaction processing constructs" 
        should simplify creation of an SQL back end.
    <li>Multiple currency support is present but shaky/untested.
    <li>Query engine is minimal/sparse in capabilities.
    <li>Linas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt; is maintaining the engine code.
    </ul>

    <p>

<dt><b>Extension Language Support</b>
<dd>Currently, the application is wired together entirely with 
    C code.  A goal of the project is to replace this wiring with
    a highly-configurable extension-language interface.
    <p>
    The overall architecture is envisioned to be as so:
    All code, including the transaction engine, the file I/O routines,
    the menus, and the ledger, will be abstracted into
    compact modules that can function independently of each other.
    At the highest level, there will be a infrastructure with
    extension language interfaces that will "wire together" the
    various modules.
    <p>
    Such "wiring together" will consist of a dispatch infrastructure
    that will allow arbitrary menu entries to be hooked to arbitrary
    modules.  The configuration for menu entries, and thier associated
    callbacks, will be specified in an ext-lang configuration file.
    At the final stages, it is hoped that new modules can be imported
    without requiring that the application itself be recompiled & relinked.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>  
    <ul>
    <li>Work has begun.  
    <li>The transaction engine interfaces are avaialable via 
        <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/beazley/swig.html">
        SWIG</a>.
    <li>The main loop is controlled by the Guile scheme interpreter.
    <li>Rob Browning is the reigning expert.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Multi-user Support</b>
<dd>Multi-user support should be added with either an SQL backend 
    to the engine, and/or through CORBA interfaces to the engine. 
    Project Kontor and also FreeMoney is working on SQL schemas;
    Kontor is also working on Java RMI/CORBA interfaces.
    <p>
    The following industrial-strength features are still needed:
    <ul>
    <li>transaction-oriented queuing of updates
    <li>event subscription channel for updates
    <li>user authentication
    <li>user authorization
    <li>non-repudiability 
    <li>encryption of network connections
    </ul>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stephan Lichtenauer &lt;s_lichtenauer@muenchen.org&gt;
        is working on corba interfaces.
    <li>"Alexander L. Belikoff" &lt;abel@bfr.co.il&gt; may start work on corba
    </ul>
  
    <p>

<dt><b>SQL I/O</b>
<dd>A module is necessary to allow data to be fetched from an SQL
    database, and for that database to be updated.  Some thoughts:
    SQL databases do not need to be locked during editing: instead,
    an optimistic approach, similar to that employed by CVS (concurrent
    version system, a mechanism for storing versions of source code)
    could be used: if the edits conflict with changes made by others,
    the edit could be rejected en-masse, allowing the user to merge and
    correct their changes.  This is a very important note: updating
    SQL does NOT require locks to be held for long periods of time!
    <p>

<dt><b>Network Banking</b>
<dd>Add ability to do on-line banking, billpay, etc.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>  
    <ul>
    <li>Can obtain stock quotes from Yahoo (NYSE), Fidelity Investments,
        T.Rowe Price, and do automated update of GnuCash data files
        (with the gnc-price perl script).  Need to add more data sources.
        See src/quotes/Quote.pm and src/quotes/gnc-price for details.
    </ul>
    <p>

</dl>
<h2> More ...</h2>


<dl>
<dt><b>User Interface Ports</b>
<dd>Port the package as a whole to gtk/gnome, Qt, Emacs.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Currently, the most functional interface is the Motif interface.
        This primarily due to historical reasons, i.e. the Motif interface was
        inherited from X-Accountant.  Maintained by Linas Vepstas.
    <li>The gnome/gtk version is second in line. It frequently doesn't
        compile, although sometimes it runs.  The #1 showstopper for this 
        port is the lack of a suitable table widget that can be used
        as a Ledger.  The ledger currently uses the gtk_clist widget,
        but this isn't really powerful enough. Volunteers?
        <p>
        Most of the work has been done by
        Jeremy Collins, with considerable help from Rob Browning.
        Daniel R Risacher &lt;magnus@alum.mit.edu&gt; keeps threatening to 
        do something ...
    <li>First draft of Qt code submitted by 
        Dirk Schoenberger &lt;schoenberger@signsoft.com&gt;.
    <li>Jim Pick &lt;jimpick@jimpick.com&gt; may be working on an emacs version...
    </ul>

    <p>

<dt><b>Internationalization</b>
<dd>All menus, markup and help-text should be internationalized,
    so that GnuCash could be usable in any country.  This
    would include the printing of currency values in the local 
    country conventions. 
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Most English-language messages have been 
        <tt>#defined</tt> and moved to a single header file
        <tt>include/messages_en.h</tt>
    <li>Plan to use gnu <tt>gettext()</tt> for the message catalogues. 
    <li>Looking for routines that can parse and print
        monetary values in different formats, as well as date/time
        parsing/printing routines.  (gnucash contains such parsing
        routines, but they're not very powerful or i18n'ed.)
    <li>Henning Spruth has translated the README into German.
    <li>Yannick Le Ny &lt;y-le-ny@ifrance.com&gt; traduction en francais
        et <tt>include/messages_fr.h</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Icons, Glitz, Icons, Glitz</b>
<dd>A set of pretty icons and button pixmaps should be created for
    minimized windows, and for the various buttons.  A user-configurable
    button-bar would be nice too.  This should probably be coupled with
    the creation of an X resource file, which does not currently exist.
    <p>

<dt><b>User Preferences</b>
<dd>Create menu system & file format for manipulating user
    preferences.  Preferences include things like showing/not
    showing categories, forcing double-entry, etc.
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Rob Browning has put together a basic infrastructure
        that unifies command-line flags with sceme-based config files.
    <li>Rob also is auto-generating the GUI ...
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Categories</b>
<dd>Provide a default list of "Categories" (Income/Expense Accounts).
    These are categories such as "Automobile Expense", "Bank Interest
    Income", and "Employment Income".  The user should be able to 
    select a default set of accounts, and have those be created.
    To actually implement this, it might be best to simple create
    a file with these in them, and load that file.  A mechanism should
    be provided to allow the user to weed-out the unwanted accounts
    without hampering their ability to use them at a later date, if
    desired. 
    <p> 
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>There exists the ability to merge 
        accounts from multiple files, and the ability to hide/show
        Income/Expense Account types.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Recurring Transactions</b>
<dd>Add support for automatic, recurring transactions, e.g. 
    mortgage payments, fixed-interest bonds, bank accounts, etc.
    Note that the design for this could be very different, depending on
    whether the multi-user functions are available or not.
    Note also, maybe the engine needs to support two dates per
    transaction: expected, and actual ??
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>April 1998 -- Design Doc contributed by Bob Drzyzgula.  See 
        <tt>src/budget.txt</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Navigation</b>
<dd>Menu navigation using the keyboard should be possible.  
    Although menu mnomenics exist, they seem to be broken.
    Similarly, tab-key navigation should be possible.   Currently,
    it is possible to use the tab key to navigate from field to 
    field in the register window, to user arrow keys to navigate menus,
    and quick-fill to automatically complete fields.  However,
    it is not possible to tab over to the "Commit" button. It should be.
    <p>

<dt><b>Folder Tabs</b>
<dd>Currently, Income/Expense accounts can be shown or hidden by
    selecting from a menu.  It would be nice to be able to examine
    different account types (Asset, Liability, Income, Expense,
    Payables, Receivables, Inventory) by selecting a tab folder.
    <p>

<dt><b>Fly-Over Help</b>
<dd>When the user pauses the mouse over a button, "fly-over" pop-up
    help windows should appear. 
    <p>

<dt><b>Simplified Stock Ledger</b>
<dd>Stocks and Mutual funds are handled by placing them each in their
    own account.  Each account can be viewed individually.  If all of
    the stock accounts are children of a master trading account, then
    the trading account can be viewed and modified in a General Ledger 
    window.  The current stock general ledger window is a bit obtuse,
    and difficult to understand and use.  A simplified but still
    powerful ledger window is desperately needed.
    <p>

<dt><b>Forced Double-Entry</b>
<dd>The system supports double-entry: every transaction
    indicates a pair of accounts: one is debited, and one is credited.
    Double-entry is a powerful way of ensuring the integrity of 
    of the financial data.  Currently, while double-entry is supported,
    its use is not forced:  the user can create dangling transactions,
    where only one account is indicated.  Although this is acceptable
    for home use (even desirable, since it allows the casual user
    the simplicity they desire), it is not acceptable for business use.
    It must be possible to enable forced-double entry, so that a
    transaction cannot be completed until two accounts have been specified.
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>April 1998 -- The engine has a couple of flags in it that control 
        double-entry behaviour: it can be made lax, or strict: 
        however, they are compiled in, there is no way to change them
        from the gui.
    <li> Dec 1998 -- Scruber functions implemented to crawl through data,
        and find all unbalanced or orphaned transactions.
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>emacs, vi, motif, kde, gnome Key Bindings for Text Fields</b>
<dd>Make sure that text fields can handle the vi & emacs key bindings,
    so that e.g. emacs-style ctrl-a, ctrl-k does the right thing.
    <p>

<dt><b>Bonds & Interest Bearing Instruments</b>
<dd>Support should be added for Mortgages, Bonds, CD's and other
    instruments (e.g. savings accounts) that pay interest on a regular
    basis.  It should be possible to specify the interest rate,
    the payment schedule, and other regularly recurring transactions.
    <p>

<dt><b>Household Assets</b>
<dd>Add an example showing how regular household assets (house, car,
    jewelry, etc.) should be treated.  In particular, show how
    appreciation and depreciation should be treated.
    <p>

<dt><b>Inventory, Job Costing</b>
<dd>Add the business features needed to maintain a stock of items for
    sale, estimating jobs.
    <p>

<dt><b>Payables & Receivables</b>
<dd>Add features to track sales receipts and other pending sources
    of income, as well as owed sums.
    <p>

<dt><b>Check Printing</b>
<dd>Create a check-printing ability.
    <p>

<dt><b>Locks</b>
<dd>When splits are implemented, and the parent transaction has been
    marked as cleared, the record should be locked, so that further
    modifications to the amount can't be performed (or at least, a warning
    is generated.  This prevents accidental garbaging up of old
    transactions.)
    <p>

<dt><b>Grayed-out Form Help</b>
<dd>Create grayed out entries in the ledger, titled "Memo",
    "Description", etc, helping users understand what should be typed into
    each field.
    <p>

<dt><b>Accounting Periods</b>
<dd>Ability to permanently lock records as non-editable.  This should
    be straight-forward by using the "reconciled" field to hold
    "locked", and not allowing the GUI to edit locked records.
    <p>

<dt><b>Quicken(TM) Export</b>
<dd>Ability to export Quicken QIF files.  Quicken import is implemented
    and mostly works.
    (Note: Quicken import worked in v 1.0, but got slightly broken in v 1.1
    It no longer merges duplicate transactions when importing two or
    more QIF files.  This should be easy to fix, as the "merge" routine
    is there in the code somewhere; its just not called because it was
    never restructured for the vv 1.1 engine.)
    <p>

<dt><b>Transaction Window Fixes</b>
<dd>The transaction window should allow the user to specify a share
    price (when purchasing/selling shares) as well as the load
    and/or fees associated with the purchase.   Fees, of course,
    are handled as separate transactions: however, it should
    still be possible to specify the fees, the transfer, and other
    details from a single window.
    <p>
    <b>Status</b>: Some basic reorganization of register was done to
       support mixed multi-line split display.  However, the actual 
       display of such things remaions unimplemented.
    <p>

<dt><b>Tab-delimited ASCII file format</b>
<dd>People *like* to be able to read file contents in ASCII. There are
    many Unix tools for manipulating ASCII.  An ASCII equivalent of the
    current file format should be easy to develop ... just substitute
    the writes with printf's.  The tab-delimited format should 
    be compatible with that of /rdb.  The /rdb format is like so:
<pre>
    field-name  tab  fieldname  tab fieldname   \n
    ------------------------------------------  \n
    value       tab   value     tab value       \n
    value       tab   value     tab value       \n
    etc ...
</pre>
    Its a very simple, very basic flat table format.  It should match
    the SQL schemas in order to minimize I/O complexity and incompatibility.
    <p>
