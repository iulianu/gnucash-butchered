<h1>GnuCash Project Goals</h1>

The people behind <a href="http://gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> 
aim to create a world-class GPL'ed Open Source Personal Financial 
Application for GNU/Linux and other Unix's.   This page aims to review
some of the technical and development issues surrounding this product,
to be a kind of 'FAQ' for developers and contributors.
To get a better idea of what <a href="http://gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> 
is and what it does, visit it's <a href="http://gnucash.org">home page</a>.
<p>
There are currently several different versions of GnuCash.  The current 
stable, production release is gnucash-1.2.x and is Motif based.  However,
development has all but switched entirely over to Gnome; the Motif version
will probably eventually fall to the wayside.  (Note that other versions, such as KDE,
Java or PalmPilot have been discussed and/or started. More about this below).
The latest Gnome version, and any latest version in general, is currently 
available only via CVS.   There are precompiled versions available, but these
are usually only for the stable releases.  Don't use the unstable versions 
unless you are looking for excitement and adventure.

<h2>Architectural Goals</h2>
There are some over-reaching design principles and philosophies that
we hope to maintain.  Some of these concepts and terms are introduced
in this section.
<p>
<h3>Separation of GUI and Data</h3>
First, one must maintain a clean separation between the data structures 
and the GUI that manipulates them, along the lines of a 
<b>Model-View-Controller</b>
paradigm.   Lists of accounts and the transactions in
them can be thought of as a representation of financial data,
a <b>Model</b>.   The GUI that adds, modifies and deletes these should 
be thought of as a manipulator of the data, a <b>Controller</b>.  
The Motif or Gnome GUI's are just two
possible manipulators of the data; others, based on <i>e.g.</i> Qt/KDE,
emacs, Java applets or Java servlets should be possible.
<p>
The <b>View</b> of the data is a subset or slice of the data described
by the Model.  The View may consist of only the transactions for the 
month of May, or only the account totals for certain accounts.  The 
View is used in part to generate the reports and graphs, but it is 
also that which the Controller interacts with.
<p>
However, GnuCash also needs to deal with multiple distributed data 
sources: stock quotations from the net or transaction confirmations
from online banks and brokerage houses,  or more mundane sources, 
such as file imports, or merger of data from several users.  In this 
language, the concept of a global Model-View is dated, and somewhat 
inappropriate.  Rather, one is worried about how data is represented
in the local address space of the GUI, how the GUI manipulates it,
how date is brought in and merged from external sources, and how that
data is again output, whether to a file or a local or remote database.
Thus, the View is essentially a local data cache: its the data that
is immediately present and being displayed, reported, and manipulated.
The Model is the abstraction of that data that the GUI (the controller)
can act on.
<p>
<h3>The Financial Engine</h3>
In GnuCash, the Model is implemented via the <b>Engine</b> API, and
the View is the data that is currently in the <b>Engine</b>.  Thus,
the Engine is a set of programming API's that the GUI (or a script,
or even a clever command-line-addict) can use to manipulate the data.
Currently, the Engine is fairly poor, and matches the data types and 
formats that the GUI can manipulate.  These include transactions, 
transaction entires (splits), accounts and account heirarchies.
The Engine has a very simple apply/commit model, and a simple 
query mechanism for generating reports and views.
The Engine currently handles only a small set of data sources: 
it can import and merge in QIF's, it can read and write its own 
binary byte stream, and can get stock quotes from the net. 
However, since the Engine is meant to be the interface between 
the GUI and the financial data, it is meant to be able to do much more.
<p>
In particular, it should be possible to back the Engine onto an 
SQL dataabase, and thereby enable multiple users and/or intrface 
to more complex accounting ssytems.  The engine should also be 
expandable to handle other sources of data, such os OFX, 
Integrion GOLD, the Open Trading Protocol, the OMG CORBA
General Ledger submission, the IBM San Francisco business objects, 
or closer to home, Linux Kontor.  In particular, it should
be possible to use GnuCash not only to view data from these sources,
but also to manipulate it and send it back.  
<p>
<h3>Modularity, Extensibility and Customization</h3>
The above structure then leads one to view GnuCash not so much as
a tightly integrated application, but a loose federation of parts
objects, libraries and interfaces.  In order to facilitate the 
glueing together of these parts, as well as simplify the questions 
of customizablity, change and rapid development, GnuCash makes use 
of an extension language to glue the pieces together. The extension
language that is most central to Gnucash is Scheme, although some
of the interfaces are also available through Perl.
<p>
<h3>Markets and Users</h3>
Implicit in this desire for extensibility is the need to build
two different types of finacial applications: one for the home
user, and one for the small business.  These two types of systems 
use much of the same financial lingo, and can share a lot of code, 
but in fact are quite different.
<p>
A personal finance system needs to be easy to use, have a simple 
'intuitive', yet powerful, menu system, and provide graphs, charts, 
net-worth reports, mortgage calculators, budget planners, and
and interfaces to on-line banking, shoping and stock systems.  
<p>
A business system needs to run over the network, allowing multiple
simultaneous users.  It needs support for payroll, inventory control,
shipping & receiving, billing, accounts payable & receivable.  
Pie-in-the-sky might include interfaces to on-line shopping carts, 
credit-card clearing interfaces, interfaces into ERP systems.

<h2>Features and Functions</h2>

<dl>
<a name="i18n">
<dt><b>Internationalization</b>
<dd>All menus, markup and help-text should be internationalized,
    so that GnuCash could be usable in any country.  This
    would include the printing of currency values in the local 
    country conventions. 
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Most English-language messages have been 
        <tt>#defined</tt> and moved to a single header file
        <tt>include/messages_en.h</tt>
    <li>Plan to use gnu <tt>gettext()</tt> for the message catalogues. 
    <li>Looking for routines that can parse and print
        monetary values in different formats, as well as date/time
        parsing/printing routines.  (gnucash contains such parsing
        routines, but they're not very powerful or i18n'ed.)
    <li>Henning Spruth has translated the README into German.
    <li>Yannick Le Ny &lt;y-le-ny@ifrance.com&gt; traduction en francais
        et <tt>include/messages_fr.h</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="graphs">
<dt><b>Graphs, Reports</b>
<dd>Add a variety of reports, including Net Worth,
    Balance Sheets, and Profit & Loss statements.  These should be
    printable: it might be best to create them as ordinary HTML pages,
    and use the printing abilities of the browser.  These should be 
    easy to customoize. Ideally, even novice users should be able to 
    create custom reports.
    <p>
    Other output format possibilities include SGML and XML.  In the
    long run, these are preferable to HTML, since DSSSL and 
    <a href="http://www.jclark.com/jade/"> Jade (James DSSSL Engine</a>
    can be used to convert to RTF, Postscript, etc.  XML is the wave 
    of the future.
    <p>
    The Report Generator should be a "dockable" subsystem of the 
    whole.  Thus, it should be possible to run the report generator
    in a stand-alone, read-only fashion without having to start up the main
    application.
    <p>
    Graphs, charts, etc. too ...
    Asset allocation pie chart.
    Graph portfolio value vs. cost
    <p>
    One hard part of reporting is designing a configurable interface,
    so that people can build custom reports.  
    <p>
    Stock portfolio tools should include a cost-averaging report.
    Market Index report.  Stock Option values.  Estimate capital gains taxes.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Simple HTML output is implemented. GnuCash will even act as a one-shot
        web server.
    <li>Reports for profit & loss, balance sheet, & portfolio valuation
        implemented as html-embedded perl scripts.  Being re-written in 
        scheme.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="stock">
<dt><b>Simplified Stock Ledger</b>
<dd>Stocks and Mutual funds are handled by placing them each in their
    own account.  Each account can be viewed individually.  If all of
    the stock accounts are children of a master trading account, then
    the trading account can be viewed and modified in a General Ledger 
    window.  The current stock general ledger window is a bit obtuse,
    and difficult to understand and use.  A simplified but still
    powerful ledger window is desperately needed.
    <p>
    Question: how to most simply allow the user to enter loads and fees?
    Answer: through splits. However, some users may not understand splits,
    at least not initially. Thus, a little popup that allows the user to
    type in the sales load or fee, & etc, and then auto-creates the needed 
    splits.  
    <p>
    Note the current transfer window does NOT allow a share price to 
    be specified !!  Needs fixin ...
    <p>

<a name="glitz">
<dt><b>Themes, Icons, Glitz</b>
<dd>A variety of finer touches need work:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Themes</b>.  A set of themes for the gnome version.
    <li><b>Button Bar</b> A user-configurable button-bar would be nice too. 
    <li><b>Categories</b>
        Provide a default list of "Categories" (Income/Expense Accounts).
        These are categories such as "Automobile Expense", "Bank Interest
        Income", and "Employment Income".  The user should be able to 
        select a default set of accounts, and have those be created.
        To actually implement this, it might be best to simple create
        a file with these in them, and load that file.  A mechanism should
        be provided to allow the user to weed-out the unwanted accounts
        without hampering their ability to use them at a later date, if
        desired. 
    <li><b>Household Assets</b>
        Add an example showing how regular household assets (house, car,
        jewelry, etc.) should be treated.  In particular, show how
        appreciation and depreciation should be treated.
    <li><b>Navigation</b>
        Menu navigation using the keyboard should be possible.  
        Although menu mnomenics exist, they seem to be broken.
        Similarly, tab-key navigation should be possible.   Currently,
        it is possible to use the tab key to navigate from field to 
        field in the register window, to user arrow keys to navigate menus,
        and quick-fill to automatically complete fields.  However,
        it is not possible to tab over to the "Commit" button. It should be.
    <li><b>Folder Tabs</b>
        Currently, Income/Expense accounts can be shown or hidden by
        selecting from a menu.  It would be nice to be able to examine
        different account types (Asset, Liability, Income, Expense,
        Payables, Receivables, Inventory) by selecting a tab folder.
    <li><b>Fly-Over Help</b>
        When the user pauses the mouse over a button, "fly-over" pop-up
        help windows should appear. 
    <li><b>Grayed-out Form Help</b>
        Create grayed out entries in the ledger, titled "Memo",
        "Description", etc, helping users understand what should be typed into
        each field.
    <li><b>emacs, vi, motif, kde, gnome Key Bindings for Text Fields</b>
        Make sure that text fields can handle the vi & emacs key bindings,
        so that e.g. emacs-style ctrl-a, ctrl-k does the right thing.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="book">
<dt><b>Books, Accounting Periods</b>
<dd>Ability to close the book at end of the fiscal year.
    I.E. Ability to permanently lock records as non-editable.  This should
    be straight-forward by using the "reconciled" field to hold
    "locked", and not allowing the GUI to edit locked records.
    Also need to report closed books slightly differently.  Need 
    to bring balances forward too... 
    <p>

<a name="check">
<dt><b>Check Printing</b>
<dd>Create a check-printing ability.
    <p>

<a name="userpref">
<dt><b>User Preferences</b>
<dd>Create menu system & file format for manipulating user
    preferences.  Preferences include things like showing/not
    showing categories, forcing double-entry, etc.
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Rob Browning has put together a basic infrastructure
        that unifies command-line flags with sceme-based config files.
    <li>Rob also is auto-generating the GUI ...
    </ul>
    <p>


<a name="ext">
<dt><b>Extension Language Support</b>
<dd>The application is wired together partly with C, partly 
    with Scheme. The architecture of the wiring and how scheme 
    is fit in needs to be reviewed, with a general overview
    created so that additional extensions & etc. can be added
    in a straightforward manner.
    <p>
    The overall architecture is envisioned to be as so:
    All code, including the transaction engine, the file I/O routines,
    the menus, and the ledger, will be abstracted into
    compact modules that can function independently of each other.
    At the highest level, there will be a infrastructure with
    extension language interfaces that will "wire together" the
    various modules.
    <p>
    Such "wiring together" will consist of a dispatch infrastructure
    that will allow arbitrary menu entries to be hooked to arbitrary
    modules.  The configuration for menu entries, and thier associated
    callbacks, will be specified in an ext-lang configuration file.
    At the final stages, it is hoped that new modules can be imported
    without requiring that the application itself be recompiled & relinked.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>  
    <ul>
    <li>Scheme/guile is the central extension language.
    <li>Optional interfaces to the data engine can be genn'd 
        with 
        <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/beazley/swig.html">
        SWIG</a>.
    <li>Rob Browning is the reigning expert.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="bond">
<dt><b>Bonds & Interest Bearing Instruments</b>
<dd>Support should be added for Mortgages, Bonds, CD's and other
    instruments (e.g. savings accounts) that pay interest on a regular
    basis.  It should be possible to specify the interest rate,
    the payment schedule, and other regularly recurring transactions.
    <p>

<a name="401K">
<dt><b>401K & etc.</b>
<dd>401K & etc. 
    <p>

<a name="note">
<dt><b>Annotate with News Stories</b>
<dd>Download, save, annotate investment news & research.
    Provide a way of storing news stories with accounts, and pssibly 
    annotating individual transactions in the same way.
    <p>

<a name="loan">
<dt><b>Loan and Mortgage Calculators</b>
<dd>Provide a variety of simple GUI utilities to allow user to calculate
    the future value of loans, mortgage payments, interst payments, etc.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Not Started.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="alerts">
<dt><b>Alerts, Recurring Transactions</b>
<dd>Provide pup-up notification of deadlines, events, upcoming payments.
    Add support for automatic, recurring transactions, e.g. 
    mortgage payments, fixed-interest bonds, bank accounts, etc.
    Note that the design for this could be very different, depending on
    whether the multi-user functions are available or not.
    <p>
    Design/implementation for this is tricky.  It should probably leverage
    <tt>crontab</tt>, but this can lead to difficulties &amp; bugs.  
    May need interfaces to email for emailed alerts.  Interfaces into 
    calendering systems? 
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>April 1998 -- Design Doc contributed by Bob Drzyzgula.  See 
        <tt>src/budget.txt</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="budget">
<dt><b>Budgeting</b>
<dd>Ability to create a budget (i.e. estimates of future expenditures).
    Reconcile actual expoenditures against future expenditures.
    Create simple, step-by-step 'financial plan' budgeting GUI's:
    <ul>
    <li>Home purchase planner
    <li>Retirement planner	
    <li>College tuition planner
    <li>Debt reduction planner
    <li>Scrimp-n-Save planner
    <li>Special purchase planner (big ticket items)
    </ul>
    Create a summary budget/track-record budget report that a 
    professional financial planner/advisor could use.
    <p>
    Note that the above 'step-by-step' budgeters will have a very 
    very different GUI than what e.g. a small-business budget might 
    look like.

    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>A design doc has been submitted by Bob Drzyzgula.  
        Take a look at <tt>./src/budget.txt</tt> in the source directory.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="quick">
<dt><b>Quicken(TM) Export</b>
<dd>Ability to export Quicken QIF files.  Quicken import is implemented
    and mostly works.
    <p>

<a name="quote">
<dt><b>Stock Quotes, Price Quotes</b>
<dd>Add ability to download stock quotes, other price quotes.
    Add ability to download historical prices as well.  
    (e.g. get 5-year history of mutual fund performance vs. djia).
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>  
    <ul>
    <li>Can obtain stock quotes from Yahoo (NYSE), Fidelity Investments,
        T.Rowe Price, and do automated update of GnuCash data files
        (with the gnc-price perl script).  Need to add more data sources.
        See src/quotes/Quote.pm and src/quotes/gnc-price for details.
    <li>Need to integrate with GUI. Right now, this is a stand-alone 
        perl script run from crontab.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="ofx">
<dt><b>OFX support</b>
<dd>Provide the SGML DTD parsers to handle the OFX reports that many
    banking institutions are providing, or will soon be providing, to
    retail customers.  See below for OFX references.  OFX is an open spec
    from Microsoft, Intuit, & Checkfree, and will be supported by Integrion.
    The OFX DTD's are included in the 1.1 distributions. See 
    <a href="http://www.ofx.net">OFX HomePage</a> for details.
    <p>
    There are two ways to build an OFX parser. One way is to build 
    a compile-time DTD parser that treats the DTD as if it were an IDL, 
    and generates C language stubs for a parser.  This approach was 
    attempted and abandoned because it leads to fragile C code and 
    a very large binary.  Its fragile because minor DTD non-compliances 
    are hard to parse, handle and recover from.  Its huge because the
    DTD  results in hundreds of (C++) objects being generated.  
    The other way is to perform run-time DTD parsing.  This is nice
    because this is the more popular approach: there are a variety of 
    XML tools available that provide this function.  Its slower, but
    on the OFX client side, this is not a bottleneck.
    <p>
    <b>Status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>A compile-time parser was developed & abandoned.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="currency">
<dt><b>Multiple Currencies</b>
<dd>Need to support multiple currencies.  Work is needed in the
    and the GUI.  The engine currently supports multple currencies 
    by treating them as securities, and thus allowing currency trading.
    The currency-trading register needs a complete overhaul.
    <p>

<a name="double">
<dt><b>Forced Double-Entry</b>
<dd>The system supports double-entry: every transaction
    indicates a pair of accounts: one is debited, and one is credited.
    Double-entry is a powerful way of ensuring the integrity of 
    of the financial data.  Currently, while double-entry is supported,
    its use is not forced:  the user can create dangling transactions,
    where only one account is indicated.  Although this is acceptable
    for home use (even desirable, since it allows the casual user
    the simplicity they desire), it is not acceptable for business use.
    It must be possible to enable forced-double entry, so that a
    transaction cannot be completed until two accounts have been specified.
    <p>
    <b>Current status:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>April 1998 -- The engine has a couple of flags in it that control 
        double-entry behaviour: it can be made lax, or strict: 
        however, they are compiled in, there is no way to change them
        from the gui.
    <li>Dec 1998 -- Scruber functions implemented to crawl through data,
        and find all unbalanced or orphaned transactions.
    </ul>
    <p>

<a name="tab">
<dt><b>Tab-delimited ASCII file format</b>
<dd>People *like* to be able to read file contents in ASCII. There are
    many Unix tools for manipulating ASCII.  An ASCII equivalent of the
    current file format should be easy to develop ... just substitute
    the writes with printf's.  The tab-delimited format should 
    be compatible with that of /rdb.  The /rdb format is like so:
<pre>
    field-name  tab  fieldname  tab fieldname   \n
    ------------------------------------------  \n
    value       tab   value     tab value       \n
    value       tab   value     tab value       \n
    etc ...
</pre>
    Its a very simple, very basic flat table format.  It should match
    the SQL schemas in order to minimize I/O complexity and incompatibility.
    <p>

<a name="tax">
<dt><b>Tax Preparation</b>
<dd>Gotta prepare those taxes. TurboTax -- categorize items according 
    to differnt tazx schedules -- VAT -- estimate income taxes -- 
    estimate itemized deductions -- find potential deductions, categorize

<a name="engine">
<dt><b>Enriched Engine, Financial Objects</b>
<dd>The current system makes a distinction between the data (account,
    transaction) and they GUI that displays it.  The data is embeded 
    within and controlled by the "Engine", which is a set of routines
    to access accounts, transactions, etc.  The engine serves as a 
    kind of a dynamic cache between the permanent data repository 
    (file, sql db) and the GUI.
    <p>
    The current engine is rather simple: it provides support for
    accounts, account heirarchies and transactions consisting of 
    multiple entries.  Many of the features described elsewhere 
    need the engine to have a far richer, more sophisticated data 
    model: parties (names, addresses), transaction id's & part numbers, 
    budgets, interest rates, A/R, A/P, etc. 
    <p>
    Note: it makes no sense to make the engine API richer than what 
    the GUI can currently support.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Locks</b>
        When splits are implemented, and the parent transaction has been
        marked as cleared, the record should be locked, so that further
        modifications to the amount can't be performed (or at least, a warning
        is generated.  This prevents accidental garbaging up of old
        transactions.)
    <li><b>Books</b>
        Ability to close a book at the end of the fiscal year.
    </ul>

    <p>
    <b>Current Status:</b> 
    <ul>
    <li>The basic engine has been detangled from 
        the GUI elements, as of version gnucash-1.1.4.  
    <li>Binary file I/O mostly detangled into a separate module.
    <li>Crude transaction logging in place; should be suitable
        for error/crash recovery but has not been tried by fire.
    <li>Backup files automatically created & timestamped.
    <li>BeginEdit()/RoolbackEdit()/CommitEdit() routines mostly in place,
        These "Transaction processing constructs" 
        should simplify creation of an SQL back end.
    <li>Multiple currency support is present but raw.
    <li>Query engine is minimal/sparse in capabilities.
    <li>Linas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt; is maintaining the engine code.
    </ul>

    <p>

<a name="sql">
<dt><b>SQL I/O</b>
<dd>A module is necessary to allow data to be fetched from an SQL
    database, and for that database to be updated.  Some thoughts:
    SQL databases do not need to be locked during editing: instead,
    an optimistic approach, similar to that employed by CVS (concurrent
    version system, a mechanism for storing versions of source code)
    could be used: if the edits conflict with changes made by others,
    the edit could be rejected en-masse, allowing the user to merge and
    correct their changes.  This is a very important note: updating
    SQL does NOT require locks to be held for long periods of time!
    <p>

<a name="multiuser">
<dt><b>Multi-user Support</b>
<dd>Multi-user support should be added with either an SQL backend 
    to the engine, and/or through CORBA interfaces to the engine. 
    Project Kontor and also FreeMoney is working on SQL schemas;
    Kontor is also working on Java RMI/CORBA interfaces.
    Another possibility is to create a web-application-server, and have
    users do much/most of i/o with a web interface, possibly using 
    the register object as a browser plugin.  
    <p>
    The following industrial-strength features are needed:
    <ul>
    <li>transaction-oriented queuing of updates
    <li>event subscription channel for updates
    <li>user authentication
    <li>user authorization
    <li>non-repudiability 
    <li>encryption of network connections
    </ul>
    <p>
    <ul>

        is working on corba interfaces.
    <li>"Alexander L. Belikoff" &lt;abel@bfr.co.il&gt; may start work on corba
