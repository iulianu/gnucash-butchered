    GnuCash currently provides rudimentary automated stcok quote 
    abilities.  If an account is properly configured, and the 
    host computer is connected to the internet, the binary 
    <tt>gnc-prices</tt> can be used to load stock or mutual fund 
    price quotes from various web sites directly into GnuCash.
    <p>
    To make use of this feature, the following must be done:
    <ul>
    <li>Create an account and mark it as being of type "Mutual Fund"
        or "Stock".
    <li>Enter a valid ticker symbol in the box marked "Security:"
    <li>Select a quote source from the pull-down menu.  Currently
        supported quote sources include <b>Yahoo</b>, <b>Fidelity
        Investments</b>, <b>T. Rowe Price</b> and the <b>Vanguard
        Group</b>.  Note that Yahoo will provide price quotes for
        most mutual funds, including Fidelity, T.Rowe Price and
        Vanguard, and that the quoted prices/NAV should be 
        identical to those on the source sites.
    </ul>

    To update the prices stored in a gnucash account file, run the
    command line command <tt>gnc-price</tt>, specifying the filename;
    for example:
<pre>
    gnc-prices myaccts.xac
</pre>
    Running this command will print various diagnostic messages to
    the screen while it loads data.  It will work only when the host
    computer is attached to the internet.  It will work if the host
    is behind a masq-style firewall.  It does not currently work from
    behind proxy or socks-style firewalls.  The command can be run
    many times in one day; however, it will update the accounts
    at most once with the most recent trading days price data.  Thus,
    if gnc-prices is run on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday,
    only two price entires will be made: one containing Friday's 
    data, and one containing Monday's data, since the Saturday and
    Sunday runs will only retreive the Friday closing price.
    To keep gnc-prices from updating one account, while allowing it
    to update another account, merely mark the data source for that
    account as "(none)".  You can do this from the "Edit Account" 
    window.
    <p>
    After running gnc-prices for a few days, your accounts will
    begin to resemble the following:
