    <h1>New Account Window</h1>

    This is what a new account window looks like:
    <p>
    <br>
    <img src="newaccwin-code.gif">
    <br>
    <p>
    Pick an <a href="xacc-acctypes.html><b>Account Type</b></a>.
    Fill in the blanks ... blah blah blah.
    The <b>Currency</b> field should typically be a three-letter ISO curency 
    code (e.g. USD  for U.S. Dollars, etc.)  
    The <b>Account Code</b> is a number that determines the sort order of the
    account when it appears in a report or in the 
    <a href="xacc-groups.html"><b>Chart of Accounts</b></a>.
    <p>
    The picure below shows an example for a stock or currency trading account.
    Note that the Scurity field is not greyed out, and that you can 
    enter a value.  That value is typically a stock-ticker symbol,
    or a three-letter ISO currency code.
