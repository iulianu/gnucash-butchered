    <h1>About X-Accountant</h1>

    <hr>
    
    X-Accountant is a program to keep track of your finances.  Some 
    of the features are:
    
    <ul>
      <li> Multiple accounts, which can be open at
	the same time.  Create one xacc account
	for each of your bank accounts.
      <li> Each account keeps a running balance and
	a reconciled balance, so you can keep track
	of the checks that have clear your account.
      <li> A simple interface.  If you can use the
	register in the back of your checkbook,
	you can use xacc.
      <li> Automatic account reconciling.  At the end
	of the month, open up the reconcile window,
	enter your bank statement's ending balance,
	and check off the transactions that appear
	in the bank statement.  This makes it easy
	to track down any discrepancies.
      <li> QuickFill... if you begin typing a description
	in the description fields, and it matches an
	previous transaction, hitting TAB will copy
	the previous transaction.  Handy if you have
	similar transactions on a regular basis.
    </ul>
