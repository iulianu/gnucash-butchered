GC-export_en.xls

I have attached an Excel2003 file for exporting data out of GC to Excel. It
works pretty easily - even for non-advanced users. I checked it for Excel2003
having some new XML features now and I suspect it is compatible with
Excel2007 upwards. I did not check whether OpenOffice-Calc provides such
XML-features.

Once the data are exported from GC to Excel, they can be processed for other
purposes.

How to export data out of GC to Excel:

- save GC-file in the uncompressed mode
- open GC-export_en.xls (with Excel2003 upwards)
- Excel: Data > XML > Import > choose GC-file (I just guessed the translation
from German where it is "Daten > XML > Importieren > GX-file auswÃ¤hlen"

... done: The sheets with the chart of accounts, transactions, clients, tax,
billing terms are filled !!! :-) Other categories can be added if needed.


gnuc2ooo.py

http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/gnuc2ooo

This is an OOo-macro that will read GnuCash output data and import it
into OpenOffice.org's embedded database, so that thereafter you can
evaluate them e.g. in OOo-Calc. A German description on its use can be
found on http://www.alice-dsl.net/gnuc2ooo/index.html .

The file gnuc2ooo.py is installed by the extension manager in
OpenOffice.org (Extras -> Extension Manager).

The files in the "xslt" subdirectory are explained in their own README
file, xslt/README.
