I have attached an Excel2003 file for exporting data out of GC to Excel. It
works pretty easily - even for non-advanced users. I checked it for Excel2003
having some new XML features now and I suspect it is compatible with
Excel2007 upwards. I did not check whether OpenOffice-Calc provides such
XML-features.

Once the data are exported from GC to Excel, they can be processed for other
purposes.

How to export data out of GC to Excel:

- save GC-file in the uncompressed mode
- open GC-export_en.xls (with Excel2003 upwards)
- Excel: Data > XML > Import > choose GC-file (I just guessed the translation
from German where it is "Daten > XML > Importieren > GX-file ausw√§hlen"

... done: The sheets with the chart of accounts, transactions, clients, tax,
billing terms are filled !!! :-) Other categories can be added if needed.
