X-Accountant
------------

xacc is a program to keep track of your finances.  It is similar in
concept to Quicken(TM).  Although xacc still lacks the advanced
features of quicken, it does have the basic functionality.  Some
of the features of xacc are:

  - Multiple Accounts
  - Each account keeps a running balance and
    a reconciled balance, so you can keep track
    of the checks that have clear your account.
  - A simple interface.  If you can use the
    register in the back of your checkbook,
    you can use xacc.
  - QuickFill... if you begin typing a description
    in the description fields, and it matches an
    previous transaction, hitting <TAB> will copy
    the previous transaction.  Handy if you have
    similar transactions on a regular basis.
    (such as depositing your paycheck every week :)

To install:
-----------

 First check the makefile to ensure that all the paths are ok.
 Also, make sure that the Xbae-Matrix widget and Motif or
 Lesstif are installed.  You can get Lesstif from 
 http://www.lesstif.org.  You can get The Xbae widget from
 ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/motif/ or any mirror.  If
 you are using a version of Xbae 4.6.1, you will need to
 comment out "-DUSEQUICKFILL" in the Makefile.

 # make depend
 # make

sorry, no "make install" yet.


Status:
-------
As of version 0.9g:
---------------
Bare-bones Mutual Fund and Stock Portfolio handling
is implemented. 
Working Features:
-- transfers between bank account & fund work
-- save to disk, restore from disk.

Bugs:
-- tabbing between fields for mutual funds does not work correctly. 

Planned additions:
-- Indicate type of transaction (Buy, Cap Gain, Dividend Reinvest, etc.)

--------
An alpha version of import from Quicken files is also present,
but it is very broken, and many/most quicken formats are not
supported.  It is not currently enabled in the code ... adventrous
coders are encouraged to hack on this ...

------------
An beta-level double-entry system has been created.
"Double-entry" is a form of accounting where all transactions
show up in two accounts (for example, a transfer from
a credit card(Diners Club) to a cash account(Entertainment Expense)
will show up in both accounts.  Modifying/deleting a transaction 
in one account window automatically modifies/deletes it in the 
other too.  

The system does not force the use of double-entry: in fact,
double entries are made ONLY when the "transfer" menu item is 
used.

A future extension to force the use of double-entry for an account
is planned, as well as the ability to make transfers directly
from the register(ledger) window.  However, this function will
be tricky, since it requires hacks on the Xbae widget used to
display the register.

Double-entries should be correctly saved-to-file & restored 
from file.

-------------
The "reports" menu item is unimplemented and will result in a core dump.

That's all folks!
