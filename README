X-Accountant
------------

xacc is a program to keep track of your finances.  It is similar in
concept to Quicken(TM).  Although xacc still lacks the advanced
features of quicken, it does have the basic functionality.  Some
of the features of xacc are:

  - Multiple Accounts
  - Each account keeps a running balance and
    a reconciled balance, so you can keep track
    of the checks that have clear your account.
  - A simple interface.  If you can use the
    register in the back of your checkbook,
    you can use xacc.
  - QuickFill... if you begin typing a description
    in the description fields, and it matches an
    previous transaction, hitting <TAB> will copy
    the previous transaction.  Handy if you have
    similar transactions on a regular basis.
    (such as depositing your paycheck every week :)

To install:
-----------

Normally, to build and install xacc, all you have to do is:

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

You can also build xacc in a seperate directory, which is
useful if you are compiling for several platforms from a
single copy of the source tree:

  # mkdir BUILD
  # mkdir BUILD/debug
  # cd BUILD/debug
  # ../../configure --enable-debug
  # make
  # make install

Post-install instructions:

   You have to set the environment variable XACC_HELP to point
   to the xacc help files.  For example:

      % setenv XACC_HELP /usr/local/share/xacc

   for the tcsh shell, or:

      % set XACC_HELP=/usr/local/share/xacc

   for csh.


sorry, no "make install" yet.



Status:
-------
As of version 0.9t:
Bugs:

-- tabbing between fields for mutual funds does not work correctly. 
-- should add "number of shares" to transfer popup when transferring
   from bank account to portfolio.
-- should do something for automatic interest computations,
   also mortgages, bonds, etc.

Fixed:
-- nasty bug relating to save/restore of double-entry to file
   was fixed!
-- Nasty core dump in motif when two register windows are opened,
   and then closed.  Beats the heck out of me. Bug with 
   vendorShellWidgetClass
   
---------------
Bare-bones general ledger capabilities added.
Working Features:
-- accounts can have sub-accounts
-- Income and Expense account types added.
-- General Ledger windows for sub-accounts

---------------
Bare-bones Mutual Fund and Stock Portfolio handling
is implemented. 
Working Features:
-- transfers between bank account & fund work correctly
-- save to disk, restore from disk.
-- Type of transaction (Buy, Cap Gain, Dividend Reinvest, etc.) now 
   supported for portfolio/mutual fund accounts.  This field can be set 
   and cleared, but is not currently used anywhere.  It will become 
   useful when reports and graphs are generated.

---------------
An alpha version of import from Quicken files is also present,
but it is very broken, and many/most quicken formats are not
supported.  It is not currently enabled in the code ... adventurous
coders are encouraged to hack on this ...

---------------
An beta-level double-entry system has been created.
"Double-entry" is a form of accounting where all transactions
show up in two accounts (for example, a transfer from
a credit card(Diners Club) to a cash account(Entertainment Expense)
will show up in both accounts.  Modifying/deleting a transaction 
in one account window automatically modifies/deletes it in the 
other too.  

The system does not force the use of double-entry: in fact,
double entries are made ONLY when the "transfer" menu item is 
used.

A future extension to force the use of double-entry for an account
is planned, as well as the ability to make transfers directly
from the register(ledger) window.  However, this function will
be tricky, since it requires hacks on the Xbae widget used to
display the register.

-------------
The "reports" menu item is unimplemented.
-------------

That's all folks!
