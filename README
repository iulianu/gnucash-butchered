X-Accountant
------------

xacc is a program to keep track of your finances.  It is similar in
concept to Quicken(TM).  Although xacc still lacks the advanced
features of quicken, it does have the basic functionality.  Some
of the features of xacc are:

  - Multiple Accounts
  - Each account keeps a running balance and
    a reconciled balance, so you can keep track
    of the checks that have clear your account.
  - A simple interface.  If you can use the
    register in the back of your checkbook,
    you can use xacc.
  - QuickFill... if you begin typing a description
    in the description fields, and it matches an
    previous transaction, hitting <TAB> will copy
    the previous transaction.  Handy if you have
    similar transactions on a regular basis.
    (such as depositing your paycheck every week :)

To install:
-----------

 First check the makefile to ensure that all the paths are ok.
 Also, make sure that the Xbae-Matrix widget and Motif or
 Lesstif are installed.  You can get Lesstif from 
 http://www.lesstif.org.  You can get The Xbae widget from
 ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/motif/ or any mirror.  If
 you are using a version of Xbae 4.6.1, you will need to
 comment out "-DUSEQUICKFILL" in the Makefile.

 # make depend
 # make

sorry, no "make install" yet.


Status:
-------
As of version 0.9c, Mutual fund and Stock Portfolio handling
is implemented, but is very much in alpha state: many features
are missing, and others are broken.  In particular, mutual funds 
cannot be saved to disk.  Also, transfers to bank accounts are
not properly supported.  Also, tabbing between fields for
mutual funds does not work correctly.

An alpha version of import from quicken files is also present,
but it is very broken, and many/most quicken formats are not
supported.

Note: in general, transfers between accounts are not handled 
properly as a double-entry system, and so deletion of a 
transfer is not handled properly.
