Unit Test Templates

This directory contains three template files for setting up GLib
g_test operated unit tests in a test directory. If your module
directory doesn't already have one, create a test subdirectory and add
it to configure.ac.

If there is already a test directory with make check tests in it, copy
the contents of the Makefile.am in this directory to the existing
Makefile.am; otherwise, copy the Makefile.am to your test directory.

Copy test-module.c and test-suite.c to your test directory and rename
them appropriately. You will very likely want several copies of
test-suite.c, one corresponding to each c file in the module directory
that you're testing.

Edit the test module file to call the (renamed) test_suite_module() in
each test-suite file. Add tests and fixtures as needed to the
test-suite files and add them to the (renamed) test_suite_module()
function.

Edit Makefile.am according to the comments in the file.

Run autogen.sh and configure. "make check" will run all tests; "make
test" will run only the GLib unit tests not guarded by conditionals
(see test-suite.c).
