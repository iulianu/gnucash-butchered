This is a stripped down version of the guile-www CVS module.  All of
the automakery has been removed and it's been reconfigured to work
with gnucash.  In the long run, we'll probably switch to use whatever
becomes the guile standard for www access.

This code is only used if we don't detect that you have a functional
(www main) module via (use-modules (www main)) during configure.
