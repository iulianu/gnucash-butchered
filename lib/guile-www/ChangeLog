	configure: Regenerated.

	expressions for different URL schemes.

	(url:unparse): New function, for turning a parsed url into a
	string.
	
	* http.scm (add-open-connection!, get-open-connection): Incomplete

	* http.scm: (http:request): Force "/" onto the beginning of the

	stupid incompatibility between the URL RFC and HTTP RFC.

	* http.scm: (parse-status-line): New function.

	separate-fields-discarding-char (which does not work when a status
