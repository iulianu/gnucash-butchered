Some defaults will relate to how to format descriptive dates, whether discount
should be considered, which account to use for certain QSF data from applications
that don't use accounts.

Some defaults are pre-defined and cannot be over-written:
- qsf_time_now
- qsf_time_string

Attributes (All are mandatory): 

\a name The text name for this default. Certain pre-defined defaults exist but
user- or map-defined defaults can have any unique text name. Spaces are \b NOT allowed, 
use undersccores instead. The value of name must not duplicate any existing default,
define, object or parameter unless the special type, enum, is used.

\a type QOF_TYPE - must be one of the recognised QOF data types for the
qof_version in use or the special type, enum.

\a value Text representation of the required value. For numeric, use the format
[0-9]?/[0-9]?

\attention Using boolean defaults 

A boolean default is not output in the QSF directly, instead the value is
used in the calculations to modify certain values. If the boolean default
is set to true, the if statement containing the boolean name will be evaluated.
If the boolean default is set to false, the corresponding else will be evaluted.
Make sure your calculations contain an appropriate else statement so that the
boolean value can be adjusted without invalidating the map!

QSF deals with partial QofBooks - each object is fully described but the
book does not have to contain any specific object types or have any
particular structure. To merge partial books into usual QofBook data
sources, the map must deal with entities that need to be referenced in
the target QofBook but which simply don't exist in the QofBook used to generate
the QSF. e.g. pilot-link knows nothing of Accounts yet when QSF creates
a gncInvoice from qof-datebook, gncInvoice needs to know the GUID of 
certain accounts in the target QofBook. This is handled in the map 
by specifying the name of the account as a default for that map. When imported,
the QSF QofBackend looks up the object required using the name of
the parameter to obtain the parameter type. This is the only situation
where QSF converts between QOF data types. A string description of the
required object is converted to the GUID for that specific entity. The
map cannot contain the GUID as it is generic and used by multiple users.

\attention Using enumerators
- enum types are the only defaults that are allowed to use the same name value
more than once. 
- enum types are used to increase the readability of a QSF map.
- The enum name acts to group the enum values together - in a similar fashion to
radio buttons in HTML forms. 
- enum types are used only where the QOF object itself uses an enum type. 

e.g. the tax_included enum type allows maps to use the full name of the enum
value GNC_TAXINCLUDED_YES, instead of the cryptic digit value, 1.

The datestring must be timezone independent and include all specified fields.

Remember to use gmtime() NOT localtime()!. From the command line, use the
-u switch with the date command: date -u

To generate a timestamp based on a real time, use the qsf_time_now and
qsf_time_string defaults.

qsf_time_now : Format: QOF_TYPE_DATE. The current time taken from the moment
the default is read into a QSF object at runtime.

qsf_time_string : Format: QOF_TYPE_STRING. The current timestamp taken from the 
moment the default is read into a QSF object at runtime. This form is used when 
the output parameter needs a formatted date string, not an actual date object. 
The format is determined by the optional format attribute of the set tag which 
takes the same operators as the GNU C Library for strftime() and output may therefore 
be dependent on the locale of the calling process - \b take \b care. Default value 
is %F, used when qsf_time_string is set without the format attribute.

Both defaults use UTC.
