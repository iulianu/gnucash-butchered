/** The gnc_kvp_bag_add() routine is used to maintain a collection 
 *  of pointers in a kvp tree.
 *
 *  The thing being pointed at is uniquely identified by its GUID. 
 *  This routine is typically used to create a linked list, and/or
 *  a collection of pointers to objects that are 'related' to each 
 *  other in some way.
 *
 *  The var-args should be pairs of strings (const char *) followed by
 *  the corresponding GUID pointer (const GUID *).  Terminate the varargs
 *  with a NULL as the last string argument.
 *
 *  The actual 'pointer' is stored in a subdirectory in a bag located at
 *  the node directory 'path'.  A 'bag' is merely a collection of
 *  (unamed) values.  The name of our bag is 'path'. A bag can contain
 *  any kind of values, including frames.  This routine will create a
 *  frame, and put it in the bag.  The frame will contain named data
 *  from the subroutine arguments.  Thus, for example:
 *
 *  gnc_kvp_array (kvp, "foo", secs, "acct_guid", aguid, 
 *                                   "book_guid", bguid, NULL);
 *
 *  will create a frame containing "/acct_guid" and "/book_guid", whose
 *  values are aguid and bguid respecitvely.  The frame will also
 *  contain "/date", whose value will be secs.  This frame will be
 *  placed into the bag located at "foo". 
 *
 *  This routine returns a pointer to the frame that was created, or 
 *  NULL if an error occured.

/** The gnc_kvp_bag_merge() routine will move the bag contents from

 *    'from' bag from the kvp tree.

 *    located at root.  It looks for a frame in that bag that has the
 *    guid value of "desired_guid" filed under the key name "guid_name".
 *    If it finds that matching guid, then it returns a pointer to 
 *    the KVP frame that contains it.  If it is not found, or if there
 *    is any other error, NULL is returned.
