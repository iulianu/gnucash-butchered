/** @addtogroup SQL SQL Interface to Query

The types of SQL queries that are allowed at this point are very 
limited.  In general, only the following types of queries are 
supported:
  SELECT * FROM SomeObj WHERE (param_a < 10.0) AND (param_b = "asdf")
         SORT BY param_c DESC;
  INSERT INTO SomeObj (param_a, param_b, param_c) VALUES
        ("value_a", true, "0/1");

For SELECT, the returned list is a list of all of the instances of 'SomeObj' that
match the query.  The 'SORT' term is optional. The 'WHERE' term is
optional; but if you don't include 'WHERE', you will get a list of 
all of the object instances.  The Boolean operations 'AND' and 'OR'
together with parenthesis can be used to construct arbitrarily 
nested predicates.

For INSERT, the returned list is a list containing the newly created instance
of 'SomeObj'.

Joins are not supported directly.
  SELECT * FROM ObjA,ObjB WHERE (ObjA.param_id = ObjB.param_other_id);
The problem with the above is that the search requires a nested
search loop, aka a 'join', which is not currently supported in the
underlying QofQuery code.

However, by repeating queries and adding the entities to a new session using
::qof_entity_copy_list, a series of queries can be added to a single
book. e.g. You can insert multiple entities and save out as a QSF XML
file or use multiple SELECT queries to build a precise list - this
can be used to replicate most of the functionality of a SQL join.

SELECT * from ObjA where param_id = value;
SELECT * from ObjB where param_other_id = value;

Equivalent to:
SELECT * from ObjA,ObjB where param_id = param_other_id and param_id = value;

When combined with a foreach callback on the value of param_id for each
entity in the QofBook, you can produce the effect of a join from running
the two SELECT queries for each value of param_id held in 'value'.

See ::QofEntityForeachCB and ::qof_object_foreach.

Date queries handle full date and time strings, using the format
exported by the QSF backend. To query dates and times, convert
user input into UTC time using the ::QOF_UTC_DATE_FORMAT string.
e.g. set the UTC date format and call ::qof_print_time_buff
with a time_t obtained via ::timespecToTime_t.

If the param is a KVP frame, then we use a special markup to 
indicate frame values.  The markup should look like 
/some/kvp/path:value. Thus, for example,
  SELECT * FROM SomeObj WHERE (param_a < '/some/kvp:10.0')
will search for the object where param_a is a KVP frame, and this
KVP frame contains a path '/some/kvp' and the value stored at that
path is floating-point and that float value is less than 10.0.

The following are types of queries are NOT supported:
  SELECT a,b,c FROM ...
I am thinking of implementing the above as a list of KVP's
whose keys would be a,b,c and values would be the results of the
search. (Linas)

XXX (Neil W). Alternatively, I need to use something like this
when converting QOF objects between applications by using the
returned parameter values to create a second object. One application
using QOF could register objects from two applications and convert
data from one to the other by using SELECT a,b,c FROM ObjA;
SELECT d,f,k FROM ObjB; qof_object_new_instance(); ObjC_set_a(value_c);
ObjC_set_b(value_k) etc. What's needed is for the SELECT to return
a complete object that only contains the parameters selected.

 Also unsupported:  UPDATE. 
 
Certain SQL commands can have no QOF equivalent and will
generate a runtime parser error:
 - ALTER
 - CREATE
 - DROP
 - FLUSH
 - GRANT
 - KILL
 - LOCK
 - OPTIMIZE
 - REVOKE
 - USE

/** 
 * Set the kvp frame to be used for formulating 'indirect' predicates.
 *
 * Although joins are not supported (see above), there is one special
 * hack that one can use to pass data indirectly into the predicates.
 * This is by using a KVP key name to reference the value to be used
 * for a predicate.  Thus, for example, 
 *   SELECT * FROM SomeObj WHERE (param_a = KVP:/some/key/path);
 * will look up the value stored at '/some/key/path', and use that
 * value to form the actual predicate.   So, for example, if 
 * the value stored at '/some/key/path' was 2, then the actual 
 * query run will be 
 *   SELECT * FROM SomeObj WHERE (param_a = 2);
 * The lookup occurs at the time that the query is formulated.
 *
 * The query does *not* take over ownership of the kvp frame,
 * nor does it copy it. Thus, the kvp frame must exist when the
 * query is formulated, and it is the responsibility of the 
 * caller to free it when no longer needed.
 *
 * Note that because this feature is a kind of a hack put in place
 * due to the lack of support for joins, it will probably go away
 * (be deprecated) if/when joins are implemented.
