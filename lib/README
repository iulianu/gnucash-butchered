The various peices of code needed to build X-Accountant are contained
here.  Some of these have been modified from thier original
distribution.  In general, its a *really bad idea* to try to fix
bugs here, you should probably start afresh with the real, original
sources.

Some of the stuff here may be down-level, different, or patched to work
with Xbae.  In all cases, examples and non-essential files have been
deleted to keep the overall distribution small.  

The stuff here will be slowly removed when patched/standard versions
that work with Xbae become available, and become easy to build & use.

XbaeMatrix:  
  -- modified to support cell widgets
  -- modified to support cursor position
  -- modified by deleting examples, other non-essential stuff.

     things work out.

XmHTML:
