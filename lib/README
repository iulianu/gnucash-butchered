Finance::Quote
--------------

Building and installing Finance::Quote is fairly simple.  It is needed
to perform stock lookups with gnc-prices and other programs.  It can
be built after GnuCash if required.  (If you try to use gnc-prices and
other scripts without Finance::Quote installed, you'll get an ugly
error message.)

Building is simple.  In the Finance-Quote-1.05 directory:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test 	(optional)
	make install	(as root)

This will install the module into the appropriate place where perl modules
live on your system.
