This directory is intended to hold any external code that is needed in
order to build gnucash, but isn't considered widely available.

------------------------------------------------

gtkhtml: gtkhtml is the soon-to-be-released replacement for the
gtk-xmhtml widget that gnucash has used up to now.  It has a few nifty
new features.  The most important one for gnucash's purposes is that
it has direct support for gnome-print, which means that we can now get
nice-looking printouts of reports and help documents.

It also works as an HTML editor, but I haven't tried that yet; might
be nice for future stuff like "live" report editing.

YOU HAVE TO BUILD AND INSTALL GTKHTML BEFORE TRYING TO BUILD GNUCASH.   

I suggest that you install it using the same $prefix you use to
install gnucash.

Building and installing gtkhtml:
--------------------------------

The default configure options for gtkhtml depend on the 'oaf' and
'gconf' packages, which are not yet available/functional, and we don't
need their functionality.  It's important to turn them off in the
configure step.  --without-gconf turns them both off.

If your gnucash install prefix is $prefix,

   cd gtkhtml 
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=$prefix --without-bonobo --without-gconf
   make 
   make install

   export GNOME_PATH=$prefix
   
The 'export GNOME_PATH' is critical if you are installing gtkhtml
somewhere besides /usr ; without it, the gnome-config script that
gnucash's configure depends on won't know that gtkhtml is installed.

If you have built and installed gtkhtml correctly, you should be able
to run the command 'gnome-config --libs gtkhtml' and see some
semi-meaningful output.  If it reports 'Unknown library gtkhtml' you
need to make sure GNOME_PATH is set to your $prefix for gtkhtml.

Once gnome-config reports the correct locations for gtkhtml, you can
go through the normal gnucash configure/build process.
