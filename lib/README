This directory is intended to hold any external code that is needed in
order to build gnucash, but isn't considered widely available.

gtkhtml

gtkhtml was stored here, but now there are more recent versions
available from Helix Code <http://www.helixcode.com> in conveniently
packaged form.


Finance::Quote
--------------

Building and installing Finance::Quote is fairly simple.  It is needed
to perform stock lookups with gnc-prices and other programs.  It can
be built after GnuCash if required.  (If you try to use gnc-prices and
other scripts without Finance::Quote installed, you'll get an ugly
error message.)

Building is simple.  In the finance-quote directory:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test 	(optional)
	make install	(as root)

This will install the module into the appropriate place where perl modules
live on your system.

Please note that the test scripts for Finance::Quote 1.01 (which is included
here) may take a VERY long time to complete.  This problem is fixed in
version 1.02 (which is still in development at the time of writing this
README).
