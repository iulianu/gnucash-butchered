/** @addtogroup Scrub
    Data scrubbing, repairing and forward migration routines.
    These routines check and repair data, making sure that it
    is in a format that the current version of the GnuCash
    Engine likes.  These routines serve both to provide backwards
    compatibility with older versions of GnuCash, and to fix
    or at least paper over possible current problems.

    It is typically expected that the scrub routines are run 
    over newly imported data, as well as during data file input.
    
    In some cases, it is entirely appropriate to invoke these
    routines from the GUI, to validate that the user input 
    through the GUI is in a format that the system likes.  
    This includes things like balancing individual transactions,
    or assigning splits to lots, so that capital gains can be 
    computed.

/** @name Double-Entry Scrubbing
    Convert single-entry accounts to clean double-entry 

    Provides a set of functions and utilities for checking and
    repairing (formerly called 'scrubbing clean') single-entry accounts
    so that they can be promoted into self-consistent, clean
    double-entry accounts. Basically and additionally, this file
    collects all functions that turn old (deprecated) data structures
    into the current new data model.

    The ScrubOrphans() methods search for transacations that contain
    splits that do not have a parent account. These "orphaned splits"
    are placed into an "orphan account" which the user will have to 
    go into and clean up.  Kind of like the unix "Lost+Found" directory
    for orphaned inodes.
