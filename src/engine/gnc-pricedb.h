/** @addtogroup PriceDB  Price Database
    The PriceDB is intended to be a database of price quotes, or more
    specifically, a database of GNCPrices.  For the time being, it is
    still a fairly simple database supporting only fairly simple
    queries.  It is expected that new queries will be added as needed,
    and that there is some advantage to delaying complex queries for
    now in the hope that we get a real DB implementation before
    they're really needed.

    Every QofBook contains a GNCPriceDB, accessable via
    gnc_book_get_pricedb.

    \warning The PriceDB does not currently use the object
    system used elsewhere in the GnuCash Engine, i.e. it does
    not use GUISD's, Entities and Collections.  Its should.
    In particular, this means that currently prices cannot
    be queried with the same emchanism as everything else.
*/

/** @addtogroup Price  Prices
    Each price in the database represents an "instantaneous" quote for
    a given commodity with respect to another commodity.  For example,
    a given price might represent the value of LNUX in USD on
    2001-02-03.  

    Fields:

      commodity: the item being priced.

      currency: the denomination of the value of the item being priced.    

      value: the value of the item being priced.

      time: the time the price was valid.

      source: a string describing the source of the quote.  These
        strings will be something like this: "Finance::Quote",
        "user:misc", "user:foo", etc.  If the quote came from a user,
        as a matter of policy, you *must* prefix the string you give
        with "user:".  For now, the only other reserved values are
        "Finance::Quote" and "old-file-import".  Any string used must
        be added to the source_list array in dialog-price-edit-db.c so
        that it can be properly translated. (There are unfortunately
        many strings in users databased, so this string must be
        translated on output instead of always being used intranslated
        form.)

      type: the type of quote - types possible right now are bid, ask,
        last, nav, and unknown.

    Implementation Details:

      NOTE: for source and type, NULL and the empty string are
      considered the same, so if one of these is "", then after a file
      save/restore, it might be NULL.  Behave accordingly.

      GNCPrices are reference counted.  When you gnc_price_create one
      or clone it, the new price's count is set to 1.  When you are
      finished with a price, call gnc_price_unref.  If you hand the
      price pointer to some other code that needs to keep it, make
      sure it calls gnc_price_ref to indicate its interest in that
      price, and calls gnc_price_unref when it's finished with the
      price.  For those unfamiliar with reference counting, basically
      each price stores an integer count which starts at 1 and is
      incremented every time someone calls gnc_price_ref.  Conversely,
      the count is decremented every time someone calls
      gnc_price_unref.  If the count ever reaches 0, the price is
      destroyed.

      All of the getters return data that's internal to the GNCPrice,
      not copies, so don't free these values.

      All of the setters store copies of the data given, with the
      exception of the commodity field which just stores the pointer
      given.  It is assumed that commodities are a global resource and
      are pointer unique.
