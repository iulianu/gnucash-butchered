/*
 * NOTE:
 * The Read and WriteAccountGroupFile routines should not be used directly.
 * They are not "safe" against file-locking errors.  Use the Session
 * object instead.
 *
 * These routines are implemented on top of the public xaccReadAccountGroup()
 * and xaccWriteAccountGroup() routines.
 * 
 * The xaccReadAccountGroupFile() method will open and read the indicated 
 *    filename.  It is expected that the file stores an "xac" format 
 *    gnucash data file.  It will return the contents of the file, 
 *    transcribed as an AccountGroup data structure.  If a read error
 *    occurred during reading, the returned value may or may not be 
 *    null. Use the xaccGetFileIOError() routine to check for read 
 *    errors.
 *
 * The xaccWriteAccountGroupFile() method will open the indicated
 *    file and write the indicated account group to it, in the 
 *    gnucash "xac" format.  It will also write out a time-stamped
 *    copy of the file into the same directory as the indicated file,
 *    with a filename of "file.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xac" where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
 *    is replaced with the current year/month/day/hour/minute/second.
 *    Returns a negative number if an error occured.
