This directory contains very broken, very experimental code
for sql support.  It doesn't work.  The instructions bwlow are for
developers who want to hack this code.

1) Install postgresl server, client and devel packages.
2) if installed from redhat, then running /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql 
   will setup and initialize all first-time setup & config.
3) as root, su - postgres then run 'createuser' to add your user id

4) run the script gnc-init.sh
   This script will automatically create the needed tables



Development Notes
-----------------
Just about everything done in this demo is wrong.
