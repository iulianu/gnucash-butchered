This directory contains experimental code for sql/postgres
support.  The code 'functions' and does many things but is still
missing an assortment of features, and may be buggy and crash a lot.


postgres install instructions
-----------------------------
1) Install postgresql server, client and devel packages.
2) if installed from redhat, then running /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql 
   will setup and initialize all first-time setup & config.
3) as root, su - postgres then run 'createuser' to add your user id

Gnucash-specific install steps
------------------------------
A) install the m4 macro processor if you don't already have it.
B) run the script gnc-init.sh
   This script will automatically create the needed tables



To Bo Done
----------
-- bug: transaction memo in double line mode is lost.
-- create database if it don't exist; provide user dialog for this.

-- allow user to enter url in gui dialog
-- handle kvp frames
-- implement account commit edit (actually, the check&rollback part)
-- fix excessive use of account commit by engine
-- provide support for more query types in gncquery.c
-- optimize for quantity of sql traffic -- there's a lot of it,
   much of it proably un-needed.

-- Implement account and transaction deletion. Deleting an account or
   transaction doesn't remove it from the database.
   (done with split delete)

-- Implement logging history in the sql server.  i.e. save the old
   copies of stuff in log tables.  Make the username part of the 
   logging scheme.

-- Implement gui to ask user for username/password to log onto the
   server. 

-- let all attached client receive update events via sql LISTEN/NOTIFY 
   events.

-- Implement various advanced database features, such as checking the
   user's permission to view/edit account by account ... (hmmm this
   done by the dbadmin... using sql commands... which means if user
   tries to write to something they're not allowed to write to,
   then they should be bounced back.

-- versioning verification in backend. The desired semantic for updates
   should be like CVS: multiple nearly-simultaneous writers are allowed;
   however, only one wins, and others are kicked back.  The losers know
   themselves because they are trying to update info of the wrong
   version. But right now, version is not done everyehwere, nor is it
   done uniformely:
   -- pgend_transaction_commit does it correctly.
   -- pgTransactionSync  does not, it clobbers.
   -- pgend_account_commit clobbers.
   -- pgendAccountGroupSync is unfinished.
   I'm not sure how critical this all is; with a small number of users
   it shouldn'tbe a prblem.  With a huge number of users, each editing
   the same transaction (unlikely!?) then there is risk of clobbered
   data, but so what?

-- fix rollback bug in gui.  If backend tells engine to rollback,
   (e.g. on a new transaction), the gui still shows traces, instead
   of kicking back.
   This is a symptom of a lack of kick-back detection in gui.
-- finish implementing pgendAccountGroupSync

-- store account balances in database.  This will be tricky ...
   -- split query gets hard ... 

-- review multiuser operation for correctness 

-- fix caching in the face of lost contact to the backend.  If the
   backend can't contact its server, then we should just save up caches,
   and then when contact with backend re-established, we should spit
   them out.  But right now, this is brroken.  In particular, 
   the use of xaccGrouparkSaved screws up some status bits ...

-- review & match up against docs at 
   http://www.lupercalia.net/gnc-db/
