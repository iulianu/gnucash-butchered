This directory contains very broken, very experimental code
for sql support.  It doesn't work.  The instructions below are for
developers who want to hack this code.

1) Install postgresql server, client and devel packages.
2) if installed from redhat, then running /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql 
   will setup and initialize all first-time setup & config.
3) as root, su - postgres then run 'createuser' to add your user id

4) run the script gnc-init.sh
   This script will automatically create the needed tables
5) type 'make' to build the demo client
6) type 'demo' to run the demo client



Development Notes
-----------------
There has got to be a far more elegant way of 'converting' c structs
to sql and back.  Because basically, that's all tat this code wants
to do: just convert the engine structs to/from corresponding records 
in an sql database.

This code only implements writing to the DB, not reading.  Its mostly 
cut-n-paste code that does the same thing over & over again.
