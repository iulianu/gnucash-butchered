This file documents the use of keys in the key-value pair system
used by the Engine. Before assigning keys for use, please read
the Key-Value Policy in the GnuCash Design Document located
under src/doc/design.

The format of the data below is:

Name: The name of the key, including key names of parent frames
      with the parent frames listed first, as in a fully-qualified
      filename. Use the '/' character to separate keys.

Type: The type of value stored in the key. The types are listed in
      'kvp_frame.h'.

Entities: Which engine entities (Accounts, Transactions, Splits)
          can use this key. Use 'All' if every entity could have
          the key.

Use: The use to which the key will be put. Include any requirements
     for using the key here. Also include any API calls which use
     the key. If more than one entity can use the key, 


Example:

Name: my-favorite-thing
Type: string
Entities: Accounts
Use:  xaccGetMyFavoriteThing(), xaccSetMyFavoriteThing()
      This key stores a text description of the user's
      favorite thing. Do not use this key to store things
      which the user merely likes!


Please put the keys in alphabetical order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: gnc:split-type
Entities: Split
Use: xaccSplitGetType, xaccSplitMakeStockSplit
     Store a string representing the type of split, if not normal.

Name: memo
Type: string
Entities: Split
Use: xaccSplitGetMemo, xaccSplitSetMemo
     Store the 'Memo' string associated with Splits.

Name: notes
Type: string
Entities: Account, Transaction
Use: xaccAccountGetNotes, xaccAccountSetNotes,
     xaccTransGetNotes, xaccTransSetNotes
     Store the 'Notes' string which was previously stored in
     the Account structure directly.

Name: old-docref
Type: string
Entities: Transactions, Splits
Use: This string holds the old Docref value which was supported in earlier
     versions of GnuCash but which was never used for any purpose. The
     value is retained in case any users were making use of it.

Name: old-price-source
Type: string
Entities: Account
Use: This string holds the old Price Source code used by earlier versions
     of GnuCash and stored in the obsolete AccInfo structure. The use of
     this value will be deprecated when the new version of Finance::Quote
     is fully supported. The new version of Finance::Quote uses a different
     scheme to identify sources for price quotes.

Name: reconcile-info
Type: frame
Entities: Account
Use: store reconcile information about accounts

Name: reconcile-info/last-date
Type: frame
Entities: Account
Use: store the statement date of the last reconciliation

Name: reconcile-info/postpone-date
Type: gint64
Entities: Account
Use: store the ending statement date of a postponed reconciliation

Name: reconcile-info/postpone-balance
Type: numeric
Entities: Account
Use: store the ending balance of a postponed reconciliation

Name: tax-related
Type: gint64
Entities: Account
Use: A boolean flag indicated whether the Account is tax-related.

Name: user-keys
Type: frame
Entities: All
Use: This frame is used to store keys which are editable directly by
     the user. The program should not attach any semantics to keys
     under this frame.
