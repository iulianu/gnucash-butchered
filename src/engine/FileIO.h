  These function read/write the data in an AccountGroup to a file.
  The read functions will automatically detect the format of the file
  if possible.  The write functions write the file in the "current"
  format.  These days, that means XML.

  The read functions return NULL on error, and set the error parameter
  (if it's not NULL) to indicate what went wrong.

  The write functions return FALSE on error and set the error
  parameter similarly.

  In most cases, these functions should not be used directly.  They
  are not "safe" against file-locking errors.  Use the Session object
  instead.
