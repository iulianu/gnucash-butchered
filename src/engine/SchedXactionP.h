/**
 * A single scheduled transaction.
 *
 * Scheduled transactions have a list of transactions, and a frequency
 * [and associated date anchors] with which they are scheduled.
 *
 * Things that make sense to have in a template transaction:
 *   [not] Date [though eventually some/multiple template transactions
 *               might have relative dates].
 *   Memo
 *   Account
 *   Funds In/Out... or an expr involving 'amt' [A, x, y, a?] for
 *     variable expenses.
 *
 * Template transactions are instantiated by:
 *  . copying the fields of the template
 *  . setting the date to the calculated "due" date.
 *
 * We should be able to use the GeneralLedger [or, yet-another-subtype
 * of the internal ledger] for this editing.
