/**
 * Scheduled transactions have a frequency defined by a frequency
 * specifier.  This specifier, given a start date, end date [present
 * in the scheduled transaction] and last occurance date [possibly not
 * present] can be used to determine that a s.transaction should be
 * instantiated on a given date [the given query date].
 *
 * There is a split between the UIFreqType and the 'internal' FreqType
 * to reduce the complexity of some of the code involved.
 *
 * Hmmm... having this in the private header file actually prevents
 * client code from allocating this 'class' on the stack.
 * Is that a problem?
 *
 * This still needs to deal with:
 * . exceptions
 * . yearly 360/365?
 * . re-based frequencies [based around a non-standard [read:
 *   not-Jan-1-based/fiscal] year]
 * . "business days" -- m-f sans holidays [per-user list thereof]
