Proposed Extensions
-------------------
The following are proposals for various, as-yet-unimplemented
enhancements.  The goal of this document is to understand some
of the changes that will come soon to the interfaces.

Accounting Periods
------------------
Acconting periods are implemented by creating a structure that
describes the accounting period, and then assigning ever traansaction to
at least one period.

typedef struct _accountingPeriod {
        GUID guid;           // id
	char *name;          // user-selectable name
	int kind;            // enum {none, week, month, quarter, year }
	start_date;          //
	end_date;
} AccountingPeriod;

The Transaction struct has to be extended with a period guid.
Every transaction can belong to at most one accounting period.


Changes to Transaction Structure
--------------------------------
Add an accounting period guid (see above).

Changes to Journal Entry (Split) Structure
------------------------------------------
Voucher Reference
-----------------
Add a char * voucher;  This is a generic id string that somehow
identifies the piece of paper/electronic document(s) that indicate
where/how to find the paper trial for this entry.   This list of id's
should probably be a list of key-value pairs, where the keys & values
can be completely configured by the user, and hold the needed data
that the user wants to store.  For the SQL backend, this is a key
to a user-definable table.
