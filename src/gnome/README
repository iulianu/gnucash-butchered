This directory contains the Gtk GUI code for the xacc application.

TODO:

1) FileBox routines
2) Code the rest of AccWindow.c see src/motif/AccWindow.c to see
   what is needed there.
3) Change mainWindow to use a ctree instead of a tree
4) Register (nuff said)
5) Lots of other stuff.. 

------------------------------------------------------

Please coordinate with Jeremy Collins <jcollins@gnucash.org> or
Rob Browning   <rlb@cs.utexas.edu> for changes to this code.
