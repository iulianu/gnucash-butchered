/** @addtogroup ChartExport Export a chart of accounts.

Remember to use qof_entity_copy routines
like ::qof_entity_copy_to_session so that the QofBook is marked
as \a partial. 

\par guidelines Guidelines for partial book export
-# When exporting GnuCash accounts into QSF, remember that there is no
   AccountGroup in the partial book, not even a root. Some account functions
   that you have used in full books will \b not work within a partial book.
-# Take special care with the book pointer. It is \b very easy to use a
   QofBook* pointer to a book in a different QofSession. Certain API functions
   also make assumptions about the current book - \b check carefully.
-# Remember that just because the function does not use books or AccountGroup
   itself, it does \b not follow that other functions called by the routine
   are also suitable. You may have to reimplement the body of certain functions.
-# Commodities are \b not supported. Most Account functions will use the 
   commodity of the account, so be sure to set at least the ::gnc_default_currency().

/** \brief Export the Chart of Accounts to QSF

Write out the Chart of Accounts \b with balances as of a
specific date, as QSF.

The function iterates over each account in the current book and 
gets the balance as of the specified date. The account is copied to
the export session, setting the export session book as partial.
The function then looks up the new entity in the export session
book and sets the opening balance of the copied account.
