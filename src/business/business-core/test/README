This directory contains unit test cases for the core business objects.


Notes on test of dirty/clean flag:
---------------------------------
Test cases will fail the test of the 'dirty' flag if a backend
is not set up.  That's because the 'dirty' flag is supposed to be
cleared by the backend only.
An object cannot be marked 'clean' unless it has actually
been saved to a file or sql db.  (Or, in the case of the file 
backend, the 'dirtiness' of the data has been duly noted, and
will be taken care of for the next file save. 
Until its saved, it lives in perpetual dirtiness.  Thus, the 
test cases need to specify a backend, then do the commit, 
then test the dirty flag.

Actually, the use of the dirty flag in gnucash is, at this time,
mildly ambiguous, and its semantics are not clearly defined.
