This directory contains unit test cases for the core business objects.

TODO
----
Some of these test casees are failing on the 'dirty' test.  
That's because the test cases are not setting up a backend.
An object cannot be marked 'clean' unless it has actually
been saved to a file or sql db.  Until its saved, it lives in
perpetual dirtiness.  Thus, the test cases need to specify
a backend, then do the commit, then test the dirty flag.
