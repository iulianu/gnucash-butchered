Need to centralize shutdown.  *everyone* should be calling either
gnc:shutdown or gnc_shutdown, and that function should be smart enough
to DTRT (like gncQuerySave, closing the GUI through a common
gnc_ui_shutdown function, etc.).  We also have to decide at what point
the user's hooks should be called...
