Overall Issues and Features.

1.  The styles still need a lot of work.  I'm not sure whether
we should handle the styles entirely within the gnome register
code, or try to make splitreg.c reasonably GUI independent.
For example, things like fonts, cell colors, cell configurations,
etc. should be dynamically changeable by the user.  Also,
the style dimension computation should take into account
the font size.

2.  Also, regarding the styles, I made some rather arbitrary
choices in setting up how the cells are layed out and drawn.
(For example, the Reconcile cells aren't dealt with very well
for multline cellblocks.)  And, it isn't clear that setting
up layouts by percentages is the right way to go.

3.  The "artwork" isn't great.  I'd like a better looking
cell cursor.

4.  There's a bit of overdraw, but it isn't clear if optimizing
the drawing is worth the effort.

Bugs

1.  There are a few drawing bugs in the register;  this is mostly related
to the style computation.
