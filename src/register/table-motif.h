 *
 * the TABLE_PRIVATE_DATA declaration should be thought of as a
 * "derived class" of which Table is the base class.  This
 * define is included as a part of the definition of the Table
 * structure in table-allgui.h
 *
 * The TABLE_PRIVATE_DATA_INIT and DESTROY are the constructors
 * and destructors, respectively, for this derived class.
 * These are included in the xaccTableInit() and the xaccTableDestroy()
 * routines in the file table-allgui.c, where they are called, 
 * respectively, last, and first, just as "real" constructors &
 * destructors would be
