 *
 * FUNCTION:
 * The Table object defines the structure and the GUI required
 * to display a two-dimensional grid.  It provides several 
 * important functions:
 * -- an array of strings, one for each cell of the displayed table.
 *    These strings are kept in sync with what the user sees in 
 *    the GUI (although they may be out of sync in  currently 
 *    edited row(s)).
 * -- an array of cell-block handlers.  The handlers provide
 *    the actual GUI editing infrastructure: the handlers 
 *    ake sure that only allowed edits are made to a block
 *    of cells.
 * -- The "cursor", which defines the region of cells that 
 *    are currently being edited.
 * -- A lookup table that maps physical row/column addresses
 *    to the cellblock handlers that know how to handle edits
 *    to the physical, display cells.
 * -- A table of user-defined data hooks that can be associated 
 *    with each cell block.  By "user" we ean the prograer who
 *    makes use of this object.
 * -- Tab-traversing mechanism so that operator can tab in a
 *    predefined order between cells.
 *
 * Please see the file "design.txt" for additional information.
 *
 * This implements the gui-independent parts of the table 
 * infrastructure.  Additional, GUI-dependent parts are implemented
 * in table-gtk.c and table-motif.c
 *
 * CONCEPTS:
 * The following apply to the rows in a table:
 * -- a phys row can belong to only one virt row at a time.
 * -- a cursor is always the same size as the virt row its on,
 * -- there is only one cursor for a given virt row.
 * -- there is no overlap; a phys row can only belong to one virt row.
 *
 * Lets say there are three cursors T(rans),S(plit), and B(lank).  
 * Lets say that these are used to 'print' the following table layout:
 * 
 *       virt row 1   T
 *       virt row 2   S
 *       virt row 3   B
 *       virt row 4   T
 *       virt row 5   S
 *       virt row 6   S
 *       virt row 7   S
 *       virt row 8   S
 *       virt row 9   B
 *
 * You can see there is only one cursor per virt row.  There is no overlap
 * between cursors and virt rows, the correspondence is one to one.  Note
 * that the three cursors T,S and B may consist of one, or more phys rows,
 * e.g. B and S may be one line each, but T may be two lines.  Thus, we 
 * have the following physical layout:
 *
 *      phys row 1    virt row 1   T
 *      phys row 2    virt row 1   T
 *      phys row 3    virt row 2   S
 *      phys row 4    virt row 3   B
 *      phys row 5    virt row 4   T
 *      phys row 6    virt row 4   T
 *      phys row 7    virt row 5   S
 *      phys row 8    virt row 6   S
 *      phys row 9    virt row 7   S
 *      phys row 10   virt row 8   S
 *      phys row 11   virt row 9   B
 *
 * This layout remains static until the next time that the table is 
 * re-'printed'.
