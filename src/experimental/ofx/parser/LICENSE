Note that some of the code in this directory is covered by
ISOGEN and TechnoTeacher copyrights.  On first reading, these
copyrights appear to be restrictive. However, the parenthetical
remarks in thier license seems to indicate that a larger, derived
work is no longer subject to thier license. Since all of the rest 
of the stuff in this directory is a larger, derived work, it would
appear that thier license doesn't apply, and that the whole can be
safely GPL'ed.
