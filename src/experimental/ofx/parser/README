This directory contains some experimental code to handle
OFX (Open Financial Exchange) messages. 

The most interesting thing here is the DTD parser "parseOfx"
which attempts to build a C++ interface that models the 
structure of the OFX DTD's.   It *almost* works.  There
are some exceptional cases that are not properly handled.

Next on the list of work items is to extend the parser so
that it will also generate an implementation for the interface.
Specifically, it should automatically create code for constructors,
destructors, as well as SGML input & output routines (parsers,
of a sort).

To check this out, run parseOfx like so:
> parseOfx dtd/ofxmain.dtd

It will print the C++ decls to stdout.

This directory contains code from
ftp://ftp.techno.com/TechnoTeacher/parseDtd/parseDtd.zip

parseDtd.C: the sample parser from TechnoTeacher

parseOfx.C: the mangled parser I'm hacking on.  

dtd/ofxmain.dtd: a hacked version of the original dtd, with 
      the intent of exposing the base types.
