<h1>GnuCash Experimental Server Login Form</h1>
This is the login form for the demo of the experimental 
Gnucash accounting server.  This server is meant to 
demonstrate the multi-user, network-enabled abilities
of GnuCash.  Note that this demo is alpha, most features
don't work.
<p>

For this demo, any username and password will work.

<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="/cgi-bin/gnc-server.fcgi">
<table>
<tr>
<td>Name
<td><input type="text" name="name" value="">
<tr>
<td>Password
<td><input type="password" name="passwd" value="">
<tr>
<td>
<td><input type="submit" name="login" value="Login">
</table>
</form>

You must use the GnuCash client to log into this server:
you cannot do so with MSIE and Netscape.  This is because
the GnuCash server returns financial data to client, 
and ordinary web browsers would have no idea of what to do 
with this data.
