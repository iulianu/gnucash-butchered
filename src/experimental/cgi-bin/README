this is some cgi-bin testing

---------------
The fast-cgi applcation requires fast-cgi to be installed.
www.fastcgi.com

This takes some doing:
-- there are two parts to fast_cgi -- the apache module,
   and the development kit.  You need only the development
   kit to build these demos; but you need the server module 
   to run them.

   (Note: instead of using the apache module, you can 
   also use the 'cgi-fcgi' server that comes with the 
   fcgi development kit.  With this program, you don't
   need to recompile the apache server or install any 
   modules.)

-- To install the server module:
   -- apache must be compiled by hand (there were no 
      fastcgi RPM's that I could find).
   -- the mod_fastcgi apache module must be installed 
      & configured as per directions on www.fastcgi.com

-- the fast-cgi development toolkit must be downloaded 
   and installed.

===================
The gnc-server is a pre-pre-pre-alpha server for gnucash.
A huge anmount of work is needed to make it run right.
