This is a directory for playing around with gnome-guile for those of
you who have it installed.  One of these days, it might be a suitable
replacement for much of the exising gnome code, but for now it's just
for exploration.

If you're having trouble getting gnome-guile to run, and you've got it
installed in a non-standard location.  Especially, if that location
isn't the same as your guile install location, you may need any or all
of these environment variables set.  The examples are for my current
setup:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/gnome
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/gnome/bin:${PATH}
  export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/opt/gnome/share/guile

The hello-world.scm and canvas-test.scm examples were taken from the
upstream gnome-guile examples.
