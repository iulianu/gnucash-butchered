/* The gnc_import_select_account():

  Must be called with a string containing a unique identifier for the
  account.  If an account with a matching online_id kvp_frame is
  found, the function immediately returns with a pointer to that
  account.  Otherwise, the user is prompted to select a GnuCash
  account or create a new one (in both cases, the unique identifier is
  written to the account's kvp_frame, so the user won't be prompted
  again).  If the user refuses to select or create an account, NULL is
  returned.

  Params:

    account_online_id_value: The string containing your account_id

    gchar * account_human_description: A human-readable description of
    the account.  Can be NULL. If it is not NULL, it will be shown before
    the id in the account matching dialog.  It will also be used as
    the default account name if a new account is created.

    gnc_commodity * new_account_default_currenc: Default commodity of
    the new account. Can be NULL. If not NULL, it will be the
    account's commodity if a new account is created.  Also, if not
    NULL, the function will also warn the user if the found or created
    account's commodity doesn't match.

    GNCAccountType new_account_default_type: Default account type of a
    new account. Can be NULL.  If not NO_TYPE, it will be the
    account's type if a new account is created.  If not NO_TYPE, the
    function will also warn the user if the found or created account's
    commodity doesn't match.

  Return: A pointer to the found or created Account, or NULL if no
  account was found or created.
