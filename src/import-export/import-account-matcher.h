/**  Must be called with a string containing a unique identifier for the
  account.  If an account with a matching online_id kvp_frame is
  found, the function immediately returns with a pointer to that
  account.  Otherwise, the user is prompted to select a GnuCash
  account or create a new one (in both cases, the unique identifier is
  written to the account's kvp_frame, so the user won't be prompted
  again).  If the user refuses to select or create an account, NULL is
  returned.

    @param account_online_id_value The string containing your unique
    account_id coming from some string of your module.  This is the
    normal mode of operation. (FIXME: is this string still owned by
    the caller or does this function take ownership?)

    If account_online_id_value==NULL, you basically end up with an account
    selector that allows you to select an account whose GUID will be 
    remembered elsewhere.  You would fill account_human_description to tell
    the user what he is looking for.  In this mode, the  online_id
    kvp_frame of the found account will not be touched.  To use this mode,
    auto_create must NOT be set to 0.  

    @param account_human_description
	 A human-readable description of
    the account.  Can be NULL. If it is not NULL, it will be shown before
    the id in the account matching dialog.  It will also be used as
    the default account name if a new account is created.

    @param new_account_default_commodity
	 Default commodity of
    the new account. Can be NULL. If not NULL, it will be the
    account's commodity if a new account is created.  Also, if not
    NULL, the function will also warn the user if the found or created
    account's commodity doesn't match.

    @param new_account_default_type
	 Default account type of a
    new account. Can be NULL.  If not NO_TYPE, it will be the
    account's type if a new account is created.  If not NO_TYPE, the
    function will also warn the user if the found or created account's
    commodity doesn't match.

    @param auto_create If 0, if the account_online_id_value in unknown,
    the function returns NULL, otherwise, the user will be asked to 
    create a new account.

    @param default_selection If not NULL, that account will be 
    pre-selected by default.

    @param ok_pressed A pointer to gboolean.  If non-NULL, whether or
    not the picker dialog was closed by the user pressing ok will be
    stored in the parameter.  If no dialog was created by the  
    gnc_import_select_account() call, TRUE is always returned.

  @return A pointer to the found or created Account, or NULL if no
  account was found or created.
