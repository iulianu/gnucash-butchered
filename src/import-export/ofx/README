This is the new OFX import module.

Implemented features (some of these are from the generic import module):
-OFX file selection
-Account matching, using unique OFX account ID
-Account creation
-Transaction duplicate detection, using the unique OFX transaction ID.
-Saving of ALL transaction data currently supported by LibOFX.  When no gnucash equivalent, it is put in the Transaction's Note field.  You must have double-line mode enabled to view the notes field.
-Full OFX investment transaction support, including commodity import and matching.

Unimplemented features:
-Account currency compatibility check

To compile:
Add --enable-ofx to ./autogen.sh (for CVS) or ./configure (for tarballs)
make
If successfull, an item will apear in Gnucash's File/Import submenu.

You must have LibOFX > 0.32 installed. http://libofx.sourceforge.net/
LibOFX depends on OpenSP , read LibOFX's "INSTALL" file.  LibOFX needs a recent version (1.5pre5 as of this writing, 1.4 will probably work fine, 1.3.x MIGHT work, but is very buggy and depends on horrible kludges in the LibOFX code.  You have been warned.).

You may want to first run your ofx file thru ofxdump to test your libofx installation before you try it from GnuCash.
