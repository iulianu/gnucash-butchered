This README needs some serious help.

SWIG is now used only to wrap perl5, and I make no guarantees about
the safety of the resulting interface.  It may or may not have large
memory leaks and other problems.  Anyone who wants to investigate this
is welcome to. (RLB)

The guile interface is now handled via g-wrap (../../lib/g-wrap).  As
far as I know, it is reasonably solid.  Anyone who wants to know why I
switched to g-wrap can ask, and I'll explain.  Sooner or later I'll
probably generate a FAQ entry, but I want to get this out the door.
Part of the reason has to do with the fact the SWIG's guile interface
leaked memory like a sieve. (RLB)

./examples contains whatever examples we've accumulated to date.
