This README needs some serious help.

SWIG is now used only to wrap perl5, and I make no guarantees about
the safety of the resulting interface.  It may or may not have large
memory leaks and other problems.  Anyone who wants to investigate this
is welcome to. (RLB)

The guile interface is now handled via g-wrap (../../lib/g-wrap).  As
far as I know, it is reasonably solid.  Anyone who wants to know why I
switched to g-wrap can ask, and I'll explain.  Sooner or later I'll
probably generate a FAQ entry, but I want to get this out the door.
Part of the reason has to do with the fact the SWIG's guile interface
leaked memory like a sieve. (RLB)

./examples contains whatever examples we've accumulated to date.

Broken-ness:
As of gnucash-1.7.x (november 2001) things got broken, because the 
module design requires that the engine be linked to scheme.  The engine
should not be linked to scheme.  The things that are broken are:

-- gnc-book.c, line 79,  
   book->commodity_table = gnc_engine_commodity_table_new ();
   The commodity table initializer runs scheme code.  But it only needs
   to do this to load a set of initial currencies; this could be 
   done without scheme.

-- gnc-session.c, line 219
   mod = gnc_module_load(mod_name, 0);
   loads te backend based on the backend name.  Not sure why guile
   is needed, a simple dlopen should have sufficed.
