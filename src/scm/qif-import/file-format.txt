QIF file format
---------------
The QIF is an old and rather broken file format defined by Intuit
for exporting Quicken data.  It is 'broken' because the format
is ambiguous in many places, non-standard between different releases
and applications, and even varies subtly from country to country (in
particular, the way dates and amounts are represented), and fails
to define important data (such as the currency denomination, or the 
exchange rates when transferring between accounts marked in different
currencies).  Importing a QIF file can require significant manual
intervention by the user in order to get the data straight.

Extensions
----------
TEF -- Time and Expense Format (see below)

QFX -- also known as 'WebConnect' --  very similar, and is the
       'new' standard for on-line bank statement downloads.

of the QIF format.

General Notes:

Dates: 
-----
Dates in US QIF files are usually in the format MM/DD/YY, although
four-digit years are not uncommon.  Dates sometimes occur without the 
slash separator, or using other separators in place of  the slash.

European QIF files may have dates in the DD/MM/YY format.  

Monetary Amounts:
-----------------
These may occur in either US or Euro format:
10,000.00  Ten Thousand Dollars
10.000,00  Ten Thousand Francs
