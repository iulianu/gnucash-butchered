These files are copies from a distribution I'm building that includes
some of the srfis implemented for both rscheme and guile.  I've
changed a few things to be more GnuCash specific...

Below is the README from that distribution.

Each SRFI may have the following related files:

  srfi-N.html             Offical upstream SRFI document.
  srfi-N.ref.scm          Untouched reference implementation, if any.

  srfi-N.rXrs.scm         Reference implementation w/o non-standard code.
  srfi-N.<I>.pre.scm      Preload file for architecture <I>.
  srfi-N.<I>.post.scm     Postload file for architecture <I>.
  srfi-N.<I>.scm          Specialized version for architecture <I>.

  srfi-N.unclear.scm      Standard definitions of unclearly defined functions.
  srfi-N.<I>.unclear.scm  Unclearly defined functions for architecture <I>.

Here <I> means something like guile or rscheme, and if you find a
specialized file, then you don't need the rXrs version.  However, if
there is a preload and/or a postload file, then you should load those
along with the rXrs file to get a complete implementation.

The .unclear.scm files will contain code to (often trivially)
implement functions required by the SRFI but whose "correct"
implemention is not well defined.  This will includes things like an
"error" function.  It is expected that you will often want to just
ignore the .unclear.scm files and define the functions they contain
locally in a way that makes sense for your particular project.  If
there is a <I>.unclear.scm file for your architecture, then you should
probably choose that over the more general file.
