The startup process looks like this right now:

  1) (at the C level) search args from right to left to see if there's
     any --startup-dir override, use it if there is.

  2) load the desired <startup-dir>/init.scm (either the default or
     the override) -- all the rest of the steps happen from init.scm
     and files loaded from there.  Any files in <startup>/ cannot be
     overridden by --load-path because they'll be loaded before the
     load-path mechanism is operational.

  3) setup the default config-vars (including the ones that represent
     the command-line options).

  4) parse the command line

  5) load the system config if we haven't already (there's a
     command-line option to load the file earlier,
     --load-system-config)

  6) load the user's ~/gnucash/config.user if it exists, otherwise
     load the user's ~/gnucash/config.auto if it exists.

config.auto is where we'll eventually spit out UI selected prefs.
