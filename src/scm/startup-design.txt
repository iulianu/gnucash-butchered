The startup process looks like this right now:

  * gnucash is a hybrid /bin/sh and guile script which first execs
    gnucash-env on itself to set up the proper environment and then
    run the rest of the code in the gnucash file as a guile script.

  * from the gnucash script itself, the (gnucash bootstrap) is loaded,
    and then control transfers to the scheme function, main.

  * the current module is set to (gnucash bootstrap) -- this is a hack
    and should change later.

  * gnc:main is called to finish starting up the application.

  * parse the command line

  * load the system config if we haven't already (there's a
    command-line option to load the file earlier,
    --load-system-config)

  * load the user's ~/gnucash/config.user if it exists, otherwise
    load the user's ~/gnucash/config.auto if it exists.

config.auto is where we'll eventually spit out UI selected prefs.
