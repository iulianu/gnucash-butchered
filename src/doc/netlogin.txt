/** \page networkoverview GnuCash Network Login

A quick sketch of how network login works when using the xml-web backend
for communicating with a gnucash server.

-# User enters in a URL Location via GUI dialogue. Location is assumed
   to be plain html, and is displayed with gnc_html_show_url()
   in its own window.
-# The displayed page is presumably some kind of login page.  It is not
   gnucash specific, and is entirely up to the webmaster or sysadmin
   to provide, modify, etc. the login & authentication information.
   The user types in name, passord, whatever.
-# The authentication mechanism issues a guid which will be used
   to identify the session. The guid is placed in a cookie labelled
   "gnc-server-sesion-guid=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"\n
   Because a cookie can be snoopedand then used to steal a session, 
   the only secure way of doing this is to use SSL.
-# The cookie is used to identify the session to the gnc-server.
