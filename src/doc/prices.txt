Prices and the Price DB API is documented in design/engine.texinfo

Below, a few meta-notes about how prices and the GUI (should) interact:

When a price is computed from the (value/amt) that a user entered
in a register, and this price is stored in the priceDB, then 
both the register entry and the price must have links to each other
(via the KVP trees) so that each can be found from the other.

This is needed because if the user enters an incorrect amt or value
or date in the transaction register, and then corrects it later, 
piossibly weeks or months later, the corresponding price in the 
priceDB must be fixed as well.

Similarly, if a user deletes a transaction (possibly because it 
contains an error in date/amt/value), then it is adviasable that
the correpsonding priceDB entry must be deleted as well (since
it is not safe to assume that the price is 'correct').
