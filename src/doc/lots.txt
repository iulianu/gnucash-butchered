						Implementation Proposal

						Linas Vepstas April 2002


'Lots' capture a fundamental accounting idea behind AR/AP, billing,
inventory, capital gains, depreciation and the like.  The basic idea
is that a set of items is tracked together as a 'lot'; the date of 
creation of the lot helps determine when a bill is due, when depreciation
starts, or the tax rate for capital gains on a stock market investment.

Definition
==========
In GnuCash, a 'lot' will consist of a set of splits identified with 
a unique lot number.  Any given split can belong to one lot and one 
lot only.  All splits in a lot must also belong to the same account.
Lots have a 'balance': the sum of all the splits in the lot.  A lot
is 'opened' when the first split is assigned to it.  The date of that 
split is the 'opening date' of the lot, and its quantity is the 
'opening balance'.  A lot is 'closed' when its balance is zero;
once closed, a lot cannot be re-opened.   Open lots are always carried
forward into the current open book; closed lots are left behind in the 
book in which they were closed.


How Lots Are Used
=================
The following sections review how lots are used to implement various
accounting devices, and some of the related issues.

Billing:
--------
Tracking lots is the 'definition' of A/R and A/P.  You want to be able
to say that this bill is 120 days old, and its balance has been partly
paid off; and you want to be able to do this whether or not there are
also other bills, of different ages, to the same company.  In GnuCash,
a 'bill' is tracked as a lot:  The 'billing date' is the opening date
of the lot, and the 'balance due' is the balance of the lot.  When the
bill is 'paid in full', the lot is closed.  The average age of 
receivables can be computed by traversing all lots, etc.  Additional 
information about bills, such as a due date or payment terms, should
be stored as kvp values associated with the lot.

Billing Example:
----------------
Normally, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bills and 
lots: there  is one lot per bill, and one bill per lot.  (Note: this 
may not be how gnucash invoices are currently implemented; this is a
propsed implementation.)

For example:

   invoice #258    customer XXX
   Order placed 20 December 2001
       quant (10)  gallons paint      $10/each   $100
       quant (2)   paintbrushes       $15/each    $30
                   sales tax                       $8.27
                                              ------------
                Total due                        $138.27

   Payment received 24 january  2002  $50      Balance Due: $88.27
   Payment received 13 february 2002  $60      Balance Due: $28.27
   Payment received 18 march    2002  $28.27   PAID IN FULL

In this example, the lot encompasses four transactions, dated
December, January, February and March.  The December transaction
opens the lot, and gives it a non-zero balance.   To be precise,
the lot actually consists of four splits, belonging to four
different transactions.  All four splits are a part of an imagined
"Accounts Receivable-Billing" account. The first split is for
$138.27, the second split is for $50, the third split is for $60,
and the fourth split is for $28.27.   Note that the sales-tax 
split, and th paint/paint-brush splits are *NOT* a part of this 
lot. They are only a part of the transaction that opened this lot.

Note also that this example might also encompass two other lots:
the transfer of paint may belong to a lot in the "Paint Inventory"
account, and the split describing the paintbrushes might be a part
of a lot in the "Paintbrush Inventory" account.   These lots should
not be confused with the invoice lot. 


Inventory:
----------
The correct way of handling inventory under GnuCash is to have a 
separate account for each widget type.  The account balance represents
how many widgets there are in the warehouse.  Lots offer an additional
level of detail that can be useful when, for example, the widgets have
an expiration date (e.g. milk) or vary slightly from batch to batch 
(e.g paint), and creating a new account to track these differences
would be too heavyweight.

In order to track widgets as single units (and prohibit fractional
widgets), set the currency denominator to 1.  This will prevent
fractional widgets from being transferred into/out of an account.

Note that using accounts to track the inventory of a grocery store
causes an explosion of accounts, and this explosion would overwhelm
many of the account GUI's in GnuCash.  The GUI should probably be 
modified to treat inventory accounts in a special way, e.g. by
not listing them in account lists, and providing an alternate 
management GUI.

Capital Gains:
--------------
In the United States, gains on stock investments are taxed at different
rates depending on how long they were held before being sold. By using
lots with an investment account, it becomes easy to track when any given
share was bought or sold, and thus, the length of time that share was 
held.

Note, however, that using lots might cause some confusion for naive
users, since some transactions might be split across different lots.  
For example, the user may have conceptually made the following 
transactions:

>        Date     Desc    Buy     Sell    Price    Value
>        18/1/01  XCORP   500             $10.00   $5000.00
>        21/3/01  XCORP   500             $12.00   $6000.00
>        14/7/02  XCORP           750     $20.00  $15000.00   

However, the two buy transactions create different lots (because
you can't add to a stock-investment lot after its been created, because
the purchases occurred on different dates).  Thus, when the shares are 
sold, the sale is split across two lots:

>        Date     Desc    Lot     Buy     Sell    Price    Value
>        18/1/01  XCORP   187     500             $10.00   $5000.00
>        21/3/01  XCORP   188     500             $12.00   $6000.00
>        14/7/02  XCORP   187             500     $20.00  $10000.00   
>        14/7/02  XCORP   188             250     $20.00   $5000.00   

In the above, lot 187 was closed, and lot 188 has a balance of 250 
shares.  Note that we used a FIFO accounting method in this example:
the oldest shares were sold first.

Note also, that by using lots in this example, we are able to accurately
compute the gains in this transaction: it is 500*($20-$10) + 250*($20-$12)
= $5000+$2000 = $7000.  If we had used LIFO accounting, and sold the 
youngest shares first, then the profits would have been 500*($20-$12)
+ 250*($20-$10) = $4000 + 2500 = $6500.  Thus, different accounting 
methods do affect income, and thus the tax rate.

Note that the two ledgers, the 'without-lots' and the 'with-lots'
ledgers look different, even though the conceptual transactions are 
the same.  If a naive user was expecting a 'without-lots' ledger,
and is shown a 'with lots' ledger, they may get confused.  I don't
know of any simple way of dealing with this. In order to have lots
work (thereby allowing cap gains reports to work correctly), the GnuCash
engine *must* use the 'with-lots' representation of the data.  If the
GUI wants to hide the fact that there are lots under the covers, it
must figure out a way of doing this (i.e. re-combining splits) on
its own.


Closing of Books
================
A few words on lots and the closing of books.  Without implementing
lots in the GnuCash engine, there is really no way of correctly 
implementing book closing.  That is because some reports, such as
the capital-gains report, need to know not only the account balance,
but also the purchase dates.  Lots provide the natural mechanism for 
storing this information.  

When a book is closed, any open lots must be moved into/kept with
the open book.  Since the splits in a lot belong to transactions,
and transactions are 'atomic', this means that the associated 
transactions must be moved into the open book as well.  A lot
is considered closed when its balance is zero; when a book is closed,
all of the lots that were closed stay with that book.  That is,
closed lots are not propagated forward into the currently open book.


Implementation 
==============
Every split has a pointer to a lot (which may be null).   A lot has a list
of splits in it (so that the other splits in the lot can be easily found).
A lot does not need to maintain a balance (this is easy enough to calculate 
on the fly).  A lot has a kvp tree (for storage of lot-related date, such
as due dates for invoices, etc.  A lot has a GUID. 



Status
======
Implementation barely started.  See src/engine/gnc-lot.h for the public API.
Neither XML nor Postgres backends support this so far.
