Overview:
---------
The GnuCash Engine implements a set of financial constraints so
that a set of basic/core accounting rules are obeyed.  The best
known example is the "double-entry" constraint: the total value
of a transaction must always be zero.  A more mundane example
is that cap gains are recorded on the date that they occur: or,
more plainly: the posted date on the transaction that records
cap gains is the same as the posted date of the transaction that
caused the gains.  At this time, these constraints are 
implemented in an ad-hoc manner.  The goal of this document is
to list and document as many of these constraints as possible,
and to review the framework in which they operate.  A possible
future direction is to formalize the framework, so that it becomes
easier to add and work with new types of constraints.


Introduction:
-------------

two very different types of constraints: GUI 
Constraints and Financial Constraints.  The GUI Constraints are
implemented as 'events', and are used to make sure that the GUI 
is appropriately
