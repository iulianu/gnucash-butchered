# environment
#
# This configuration file can be used to change/add
# environment variables during GnuCash startup.
#
# If you make any changes here, you should probably
# also change the equivalent sections in:
# - src/bin/environment.in
# - src/bin/environment-osx.in
# - packaging/win32/gnucash.iss.in
# - packaging/win32/install.sh

[Variables]
# For now most of the environment is still set in
# the install script or the installer. You can override
# or add additional variables here.
