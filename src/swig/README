This README needs some serious help.

./examples contains whatever examples we've accumulated to date.

Each language interface is built in a separate subdirectory.  Right
now we have guile and perl5.  A simple "make" should build everything.

Building guile will result in guile/xacc-guile, a simple interpreter
that will let you execute scheme forms (including xacc commands).  We
need to add an example of building a dynamically loadable guile module
later, but guile/xacc-guile.c shows you how easy it is to embed a
guile interpreter in your app, and then load all the xacc functions
into the interpreter.

Building perl5 will result in a perl module.  For an example of how to
use it, see ../cbb/cbb-to-xacc.
