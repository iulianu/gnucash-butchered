Version history:
------- -------
 0.9 - 08 Sep 97
         o  Lots of code-cleanup.
         o  Adjust Balance window.
         o  Reconcile window!  Makes it easy to reconcile your account
            at the end of the month when you get your new bank statement.
         o  Hypertext, context sensitive help.  A pretty nice add-on,
            thanks to libhtmlw, from NCSA Mosaic.  (Now someone just
            has to write some decent help pages!)
         o  Fixed busy cursor.  Previously the code the switched cursors
            caused the program to crash, so it wasn't enabled.  Now it
            works, and is enabled.

 0.7 - 14 Jul 97
         o  Started adding support for account types other than "BANK".
            Still no support for Portfolio and Mutual accounts.  (They
            are greyed out in the "New Account" window for now.)
         o  Changed the balance field to use red/black text to denote
            negative/positive balance (instead of using a sign... If you
            define USE_NO_COLOR when compiling, it will revert to the
            old method of displaying a '-' in front of negative balances)
         o  Fixed bug in automatic transfers that cause the "From"
            account to always be the first account, and the "To" account
            to possibly be incorrect.  Also, added "[To: ]" "[From: ]"
            (with to account name, and from account name) to the start
            of the memo field, so you can keep track of where the money
            comes from/goes to.

 0.6 - 28 Jun 97
         o  Fixed balance/reconciled field (in bottom right corner
            of register window.  (It sorta works now, with lesstif.
            I don't know about motif... you have to leave the current
            transaction for the balances to be recalculated.)
         o  Rearranged directory structure... the source was growing
            to too many files to have it all in one directory.

 0.5 - 6 Jun 97    Mostly, minor bug fixes
         o  verifyDate  -- affects when accelerator keys in the
            register window cause the date to cross a year boundary
         o  Fixed handling of the date in the transfer window.  Before
            if the user pressed the "transfer" button with an incomplete
            date in the date field, the resulting date would be
            undefined.
         o  If the user doesn't enter data in the description field,
            The number field, the memo field, or one of the amount
            fields, the the new transaction isn't added when the
            user leaves the new transaction, or presses "Record"
         o  Now user is prevented from entering more than one '.'
            in the amount fields in the register and transfer windows.
            Also, the user is prevented from entering more than two
            '/' in the date field in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a (very small) memory leak in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a bug in the transfer window that resulted in a
            different amount subtracted from the "from" account as was
            added to the "to" account.
         o  Fixed bug that caused a segfault when deleting the last
            transaction in the register window.
         o  Now if the user is in the last transaction (the empty
            transaction) in the register window, the "Delete" button
            does not do anything.
 
 0.4 - 3 Jun 97
         o  Added "Balance" and "Reconciled" balance to the bottom
            right corner of the register window.  
         o  The main window uses an Xbae-Matrix widget now, instead
            of a list, in order to line up the account names, types,
            and balances in nice columns.
	
 0.2 - First (mostly) functional release.  Most of the buttons,
       and menu bar choices actually do something now.

 0.1 - First demo release.  Lots of buttons, and menu bar choices
       Don't do anything.  The register window is still pretty
       buggy.





Things to do/fix:    (in no particular order)
------ -- ------

  o  Reg window segfaults on close... (I think this might be a
     lesstif problem, so try a newer version)
 
  o  memorized transactions/quickfill (They work, but you need
     a newer than v4.6.1 Xbae Widget)

  o  Bug Fixes!  There are still a few bugs floating around.
     (Let me know if you find any)

  o  a README and/or man page!

  o  use configure or Imake?  or at least a proper "make install"
