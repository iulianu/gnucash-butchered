Installing GnuCash Motif on a SuSE Linux Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

Installing GunCash on SuSE is a little tricky. There are a couple of
necessary components missing. This README describes how I got I working.

This does not mean that it's the only (or optimal) way of getting GnuCash
ready. But there are several other options which are worse (and I happened
to "test" some of them...) 

To get GnuCash compiled you will need
 
gnucash-1.1.25.tar.gz ("NOT REALLY??")
eperl-2.2.14.tar.gz 
Xbaelin-4.6.2.4.tar.gz
guile-core-19980818.tar.gz
XmHTML-1.1.5-1-rh51.i386.rpm

The packages named above can be downloaded directly from GnuCash's ftp site
at ftp.gnucash.org. The rpm files can be installed using SuSE's YaST, the 
.tar.gz files can be unpacked with tar xfvz file.tar.gz. They can be 
configured and installed as described in their READMEs, I did not experience
any difficulties with them.

a1  libz
gra libgif
gra libjpeg

These are packages from the distribution from the a1 and gra series
(This is true for SuSE 6.0, on older versions they may be located 
elsewhere). YaST installs the linker related stuff in /usr/X11R6/lib.
GnuCash won't find them there so you either edit GnuCash configure script
(then you're on your own) or you symlink the files like this:

ln -s /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a /usr/lib
                     libpng.a
                     libjpg.a

swig1.1p5.tar.gz		http://www.swig.org
readline-2.1-5.i386.rpm	 http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/redhat/5.0/i386/readline-2.1-5.i386.html
nana-2.3.tar.gz http://www.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/

These files can be obtained from their different locations. They compile and
install without any problems.

Then there was LessTif ...
To compile the Motif version of GnuCash, you will need LessTif, the freeware
clone of this GUI library. It's not the problem LessTif on the net, it's 
rather the question of finding an *appropriate* version.

I had luck with the lesstif-0.86.0.tar.gz from 
ftp.lesstif.org/pub/hungry/lesstif/srcdist/obsolete/ This one is stored 
in a directory named "obsolete", but GnuCash or its components depend on 
some calls which are kind of "gone" in later versions so you should 
stick with this one. If you can get GnuCash running with any later LessTif
version, report this, so this file can be updated. 

The file lesstif-0.86.0.tar.gz contains the source of lesstif which requires
several MBs of disk space to compile so don't forget "make clean" after 
you installed it ;)

That's it! "configure; make motif" and GnuCash should be ready.

Have fun,
