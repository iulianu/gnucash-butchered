This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of gnucash, an application
to track finances in multiple accounts, keeping running and reconciled
balances.  Gnucash was written by Robin D. Clark and Linas Vepstas.

This package was debianized by Tyson Dowd <trd@cs.mu.oz.au> Wed, 10 Mar 1999
13:02:16 +1100.  John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org> is the Debian
maintainer effective June 2, 2000.  It was downloaded from
ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/gnucash/sources/unstable/1.3.x/1.3.3/gnucash-1.3.3.tar.gz

The source package includes the Motif widget ComboBox-1.33, which is GPL:

	(c) 1993, 1994 Harald Albrecht
	This software is Free Software. Please refer to the file
	COPYING, which you should have received together this file and the
	source code of the combo box widget.  However if you find this
	widget to be useful, you are encouraged to donate a reasonable
	amount to a charitable institution -- there are enough people
	out there who need help! Sometimes I got the strong impression
	that programmers tend to get lost in their own "virtual reality"
	- sitting in front of their screen, hacking new algorithms and
	forget about everything around them.  So please don't forget
	about people who need help.

The source package includes a modified version of the Motif widget
