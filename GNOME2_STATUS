Intro
-----

This is a ad-hoc list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

    | Can someone who comes across this note and wants to help please go
    | through 1.8.x and create a list of stuff missing from 2.0?

            General Notes
========================================

Resources
---------
- Porting applications to the GNOME 2.0 Platform -- http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/porting/
- Introduction to GConf -- http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gconf/gconf.html

- General

  - Printing

    - Printing checks works.
    - Printing text reports works.
    - Printing pie/bar charts fails.

  - Open pages are no longer open after reopening file.
    - Account tree, register and report pages are restored.
    - Budget and business pages are not restored.
    - Trying to reopen a multi-column report spits lots of
      warning. Trying to edit that pages options crashes gnucash.

- Register Core - mostly functional

  - doesn't remember custom check formats.

  - Edit > {Cut,Copy,Paste} not functioning on first invocation.

- Reporting / Graphing [mostly functional]

  - Graphing working, with some known issue; see top
    of src/gnome-utils/gnc-html-graph-gog.c for more detail.

    - colors

    - axis-label string rotation

    - Known issue with height/width bug in libgtkhtml 3.3.2 (on FC3).

  - When rendering, progress bar always says "Rendering 'Untitled' report...".

    - warlord reports this was true in 1.8 as well.

  - Tax Report / TXF Export

    - incorrect "Sub-4 Sub-3 Sub-2 Sub-1 Total" supposed-to-be-column-header lines?
      [http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2006-January/015337.html]

  - Assets Barchart
    [http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2006-January/015337.html]

    - With stacked barchart, 13 bars @ 1200x800 sorted by amount, the graph
      is very compressed; with >13 bars, nothing is displayed.

    - Legend uses a huge font.

- Budgeting

  - Budget Report

    - the default account selection isn't very reasonable, Inc & Exp
      would be better

    - sometimes negative numbers render on two lines in their table-cell

  - Budget GUI

    - default account filter doesn't take effect until options are
      opened, should take effect as soon as view is opened

    - it might be nice to disallow some of the more unusual recurrences

    - better if budget list dialog allowed double click to open

    - need help text

    - should displaying zero values be optional?

    - it'd be nice if there was a summary column at the far right

  - Budget Engine

    - Do budgets play nice with QSF?

    - Still a lot of dead legacy code hanging around

- New Account Hierarchy... - mostly works

  - Better text on opening/balance merge druid-page needed.

- Import QSF

  - Static variables used for process/window state.

  - Misc errors with no apparent cause

    - (gnucash:27485): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed

    - (gnucash:27485): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed

  - conflict-resolution process/display issues.

- Backend

  - price_lookup awaits a solution - as a query instead of a backend operation.

- Scheduled Transactions

  - Since Last Run dialog should be audited for menus and ledger capabilities.

    - e.g. The To-Create-Transaction read-only review ledger doesn't need any
      menus or editing functionality.

  - [minor] Since Last Run uses deprecated GTKCTrees.

  - SX Editor

    - bugs/crashes:

      - http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2005-December/015097.html

      - http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2006-January/015300.html

    - Template-register View > {Basic, Auto-Split} options have no effect

      - Note: they *shouldn't* have any effect, as they don't apply to
        General Ledgers.  That means, however, they should either not appear
        or be disabled.

  - Open SX Editor, close it; open Register Preferences, change "Draw
    {horiz,vert} lines" => crash.

========================================
              ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

- New icons

  - Add account.

  - Register

  - Report

    - "Report options", especially, since it often confuses users.

- Account tree drag-and-drop reparenting.

- Find

  - There's no way to edit/refine a search.
    [There's no way to do so in 1.8, either...]

- Scheduled Transactions

  - Entering a value (e.g. '20.00') without entering an account or a memo for
    the first split causes everything else entered so far to be reset when
    tabbing to the second split.
