Intro
-----

This is a ad-hoc list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

  - Printing

    - Printing checks works.

    Use of deprecated SAXv1 function getLineNumber

  - Open pages are no longer open after reopening file.
    - Account tree, register and report pages are restored.
    - Budget and busines pages are not restored.
    - Trying to reopen a multi-column report spits lots of
      warning. Trying to edit that pages options crashes gnucash.

  - Weird pango_layout_set_text "string not UTF-8" issues reported by Neil Williams:

    - http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2005-March/012824.html

- Register Core - mostly functional

  - doesn't remember custom check formats.

- Reporting / Graphing [mostly functional]

  - Graphing working, with some known issue; see top
    of src/gnome-utils/gnc-html-graph-gog.c for more detail.

    - colors

    - axis-label string rotation

    - Known issue with height/width bug in libgtkhtml 3.3.2 (on FC3).

  - When rendering, progress bar always says "Rendering 'Untitled' report...".

    - warlord reports this was true in 1.8 as well.

- Importing

  - HBCI - Transaction templates eventually need to be converted from a GTK_CLIST
    to a GTK_TREE_VIEW.  Currently working as a GtkClist. 


- Budgeting

  - Budget Report

    - the default account selection isn't very reasonable, Inc & Exp
      would be better

    - sometimes negative numbers render on two lines in their table-cell

  - Budget GUI

    - default account filter doesn't take effect until options are
      opened, should take effect as soon as view is opened

    - it might be nice to disallow some of the more unusual recurrences

    - better if budget list dialog allowed double click to open

    - need help text

    - should displaying zero values be optional?

    - it'd be nice if there was a summary column at the far right

  - Budget Engine

    - Do budgets play nice with QSF?

    - Still a lot of dead legacy code hanging around

- New Account Hierarchy - somewhat works

  - Simply invoking, even if cancelled, trashes current book state?

  - Sometimes crashes when loading account data.

  - Main account selection layout is too (visually) compressed
 
    - Should have two columns: left={category(80%) + detailed-description(20%)}, right={category-accounts(100%)}

    - See 'relayout Hierarchy' in src/gnome/glade/account.glade.

  - Account tree's only column (account name) is relatively thin, truncating
    some titles.

    - It seems that gnc_tree_view_add_text_column sets column-width based on
      an example string, whereas in this use-case the best would be to set to
      '0'(=autosize).

- Account Hierarchy Merge - BROKEN

  - Bad integration with Account Hierarchy druid

  - Static variables used for process/window state.

  - Misc errors with no apparent cause

    - (gnucash:27485): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed

    - (gnucash:27485): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed

  - Doesn't let you complete the conflict resolution process, thus you can never complete the druid.

    - (jsled) actually, it just doesn't display the 1-conflict -> 0-conflict
      transition in the UI correctly, but it does allow you to finish.

  - conflict-resolution process/display issues.

- Backend

  - price_lookup awaits a solution - as a query instead of a backend operation.

- Scheduled Transactions

  - Since Last Run dialog spews console-crap on init, generally broken?

  - SX Editor

    - When tabbing from memo to account on the second split with the same
      name as the first, the account will be auto-populated with a GUID
      (instead of an account name), but not a valid one.

    - Template-register Cut/Copy/Paste not connected.

    - Template-register View > {Basic, Auto-Split} options have no effect.

  - Open SX Editor, close it; open Register Preferences, change "Draw
    {horiz,vert} lines" => crash.

  - Entering a value (e.g. '20.00') without entering an account or a memo for
    the first split causes everything else entered so far to be reset when
    tabbing to the second split.

========================================
              ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

- New icons

  - Add account.

  - Register

  - Report

    - "Report options", especially, since it often confuses users.

- In-place editing

  - Provide in-place editing where feasable.  Eg.  Editing the account code
    or the account name, but not being able to re-parent the account.  (Maybe
    add DND support for this in long-term?)

- Find

  - There's no way to edit/refine a search.
    [There's no way to do so in 1.8, either...]

- Main Window

  - Change Notebook tabs to include an 'x' to act as the "close tab" method,
    and then remove the "Close" button from the toolbar.  Then we can also
    decide if we want to allow a user to 'close' the account tree.
